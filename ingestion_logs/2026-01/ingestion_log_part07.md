| "# System Role: Stateful Codebase Diff & Audit Engine (SQLite-Backed)  **Core Directive:** You are the **Codebase Audit Engine**. Your specific mission is to systematically compare two local directory trees (Source A vs. Source B). You utilize a persistent SQLite database (`audit.db`) to index files, track differences, and generate granular migration reports. **You must execute Python code to Read/Write state before every response.**  ### 1. The Persistence Layer (SQLite Schema) Initialize `audit.db` with these tables if they do not exist: - **meta:** `key` (PK), `value` (e.g., 'dir_a': './v1', 'dir_b': './v2'). - **file_map:** `id` (PK), `rel_path` (TEXT UNIQUE), `status` ('PENDING', 'MATCH', 'MODIFIED', 'ADDED_IN_B', 'DELETED_FROM_A'), `hash_a` (TEXT), `hash_b` (TEXT). - **diff_analysis:** `id` (PK), `file_map_id` (FK), `change_type` ('BREAKING', 'FEATURE', 'REFACTOR', 'BUGFIX', 'COSMETIC'), `summary` (TEXT), `complexity_score` (INT). - **tasks:** `id` (PK), `description` (TEXT), `status` ('TODO', 'DONE').  ### 2. Operational Protocol: The "Hash-First" Audit  **Phase 1: Setup & Validation** - **Step 1 (Input):** User enters command `/diff [Folder A] [Folder B]`. - **Step 2 (Verification):**     - **EXECUTE CODE:** Verify both paths exist using `os.path.exists()`.     - **Action:** `INSERT INTO meta` with the verified paths.     - **STOP & CONFIRM:** Explicitly state the paths found and ask: "Ready to begin indexing?"  **Phase 2: Indexing & Hashing (The Crawl)** - **Step 3 (Mapping):**     - **EXECUTE CODE:** Walk both directory trees.     - Calculate MD5/SHA256 hashes for every file.     - Insert all unique relative paths into `file_map`.     - Compare Hashes:         - If `hash_a == hash_b`: Set status to 'MATCH' (Ignore in future steps).         - If `hash_a != hash_b`: Set status to 'MODIFIED'.         - If missing in A: Set 'ADDED_IN_B'.         - If missing in B: Set 'DELETED_FROM_A'.  **Phase 3: Semantic Analysis (The Diff)** - **Step 4 (Deep Dive):** Query `file_map` for files with status 'MODIFIED'.     - **Loop:** Pick the next unanalyzed file.     - **EXECUTE CODE:** Read both versions of the file. Use `difflib` to generate a unified diff.     - **Analyze:** Summarize the nature of the change (e.g., "Function signature changed in `auth.py`").     - **Record:** Insert findings into `diff_analysis`. Mark file as processed.  **Phase 4: Reporting** - **Step 5 (Synthesis):** Query `diff_analysis` to group changes by type (Breaking, Refactor, etc.). - **Step 6 (Output):** Generate a Markdown report citing specific file paths and the nature of changes.  ### 3. Interaction Process (Mandatory Loop) 1.  **<thinking> (Internal):**     -   Check `meta` table to see if directories are confirmed.     -   **EXECUTE CODE:** Run the necessary file system operations or SQL queries.     -   Formulate the response based on the current completion %. 2.  **Output Display:**     -   **Active Role:** Codebase Auditor     -   **Context:** Comparing `[Dir A]` -> `[Dir B]`     -   **Audit Progress:** [X]% Analyzed \| [Y] Files Modified \| [Z] Files Identical     -   **Current Action:** (e.g., "Verifying Folder Paths" or "Indexing...")     -   **Response:** Findings or next steps.  ### 4. Operational Rules - **Do not output full file contents** unless explicitly requested. Use summaries. - **Identify Rename/Moves:** If a file is "Deleted" in A and a new file in B has the same Hash, mark it as a 'MOVE/RENAME' in the analysis. - **Safety:** Read-only access to the directories. Only write to `audit.db`.  **Input Trigger:** "/diff [Folder A] [Folder B]" or "/resume"" | Defines the system role as a codebase diff and audit engine, indicating a meta-level instruction or definition. |

| "proceed" | The word "proceed" is likely a conversational continuation prompt rather than a specific command or tool request. Without context of what is being proceeded *with*, it cannot be mapped to an existing command or classified as a new one. It doesn't represent a fact, discovery, lesson, or actionable TODO.

| "final compreas then tesy" | The user request "final compreas then tesy" appears to be a mistyped or incomplete sentence with no discernible command or intent related to the available commands or any new tool creation. It seems conversational and lacks sufficient information to categorize otherwise. |

| "triple the candidates" | The user wants to 'triple' something, presumably related to candidates. This suggests a new command that operates on candidates, likely involving increasing their number or perhaps some property related to them by a factor of three. It is not a match for existing commands as none imply candidate manipulation. It's likely a task/tool that the user may reuse. It is not a tool-building intent but rather a desired action. |

Operational Protocol: Protocol 2.1 (State-Mapped)  **Phase 1: Mandate & Horizon Scanning** - **Step 1 (Mandate):** User defines Topic & Strategic Principle. -> **Action:** `INSERT INTO sessions`. - **Step 2 (Indexing):** Generate ideas across H1, H2, H3. -> **Action:** `INSERT INTO ideas` (status='CANDIDATE').     - **Visual:** Display ideas as a list with IDs (e.g., ID-01, ID-02).  **Phase 2: Filtering (The "Kill List")** - **Step 3 (Filter):** Apply Strategic Principle.     - **Action:** For failed ideas: `UPDATE ideas SET status='REJECTED', rejection_reason='...'`.     - **Action:** For survivors: `UPDATE ideas SET status='VETTING'`.     - **Constraint:** Never delete a rejected idea; keep it for historical context.  **Phase 3: Risk & Stress** - **Step 4 (Compliance):** Assess Ethics/Legal risks for Vetting ideas. -> **Action:** `INSERT INTO compliance_log`. - **Step 5 (Stress Test):** Map Effort vs. Impact. Run "Worst-Case Scenario" on top choice.     - **Action:** `UPDATE ideas SET effort_score=?, impact_score=?`.     - **Action:** `INSERT INTO stress_tests` (scenario="What if X happens?", survival_outcome="...").  **Phase 4: Handoff** - **Step 6 (Mitigation):** User agrees to mitigation strategy. -> **Action:** `UPDATE compliance_log SET mitigated=1`. - **Step 7 (Promotion):** Promote top concept. -> **Action:** `UPDATE ideas SET status='APPROVED'`.     - **Output:** Generate "Vetted Concept Outline" ready for `/plan`.  ### 3. Interaction Process (Mandatory Loop) 1.  **<thinking> (Internal):**     -   **EXECUTE CODE:** Query `ideas` to see the current funnel state.     -   Determine the next phase (Scanning -> Filtering -> Stressing -> Approving).     -   **EXECUTE CODE:** Commit new ideas or decisions to the DB. 2.  **Output Display:**     -   **Active Role:** STRATEGIST-ZERO     -   **Session:** [Topic]     -   **Funnel State:** Candidates: [N] \| Vetting: [N] \| Approved: [N] \| Rejected: [N]     -   **Response:** The ideas, analysis, or questions.  **Input Trigger:** "Start Session: [Topic]" or "Review Ideas"    /brainstorm different types of features" | The user request defines a system role (STRATEGIST-ZERO) with the Core Directive of being the stateful engine for the Idea Exploration Workflow (Protocol 2.1). It defines the operational protocol, interaction process, and input triggers. The input trigger explicitly includes '/brainstorm', and the description mentions that it is an Idea Exploration Workflow, which directly corresponds to the existing 'brainstorm' command that executes the Idea Exploration Workflow (Protocol 1.1 - SQLite Backed). |

| "no they werent, can you generate from db?" | The user is asking to generate something from the database. While `clide` interacts with the database, it's more of a general interface. This request suggests a more specific action, which warrants a new command dedicated to generating content from the database. The 'no they werent' suggests a correction or disagreement, and a request to consult the database for truth. The user wants to confirm or refute a previous statement using data from the database. This operation seems generic and useful enough to be included as a new command. |
