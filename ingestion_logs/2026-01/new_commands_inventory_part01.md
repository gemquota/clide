**COMMAND:** `` `improve_interface` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Analyze a screenshot, critique the interface, and generate a prompt for improving the displayed interface.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `57f20c67` | The user wants a new command that combines screenshot analysis, critique, and prompt generation for interface improvement. This doesn't directly match any existing command, but it represents a potentially reusable workflow. | interface, critique, prompt, screenshot, design, improvement, ui |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `recursive_critique` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Execute current task, recursively critique the work produced, and design the next prompt based on the critique.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `57f20c67` | The user is asking to perform a series of actions: execute the current task, critique the work, and then design the next prompt. This does not match an existing command, nor is it a request to build a new technical tool. It is more of a high-level behavioral command that could be reused. It also goes beyond a simple review. | critique, recursion, prompt engineering, design, self-improvement |

**COMMAND:** `` `engineer` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement a command, likely named 'dissect', that will recursively analyze a directory's contents, determine the program's nature, conduct broad and targeted code investigations, extract all necessary logic, annotate and save the full logic export as an .md file in a new 'logic' directory. Further, the command should perform conceptual, semantic, and logical analysis of the program, subdivide its functionality into multiple discrete, independently runnable programs (v1), and subsequently upgrade them to be interoperable (v2) such that initiating program B from A would provide A with B's functionality.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `57f20c67` | The user is asking to dissect an existing program, extract its logic, refactor it into discrete, interoperable parts, and document the process. While `engineer` is a existing command, the user's request is much broader in scope of how the engineer would examine the source, this goes beyond the standard engineering practices and instead calls for a far greater amount of program analysis and code dissection.
