**COMMAND:** `` `resume_logic_export` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Resume logic export v2, incorporating code extracts into the initial export before resuming.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `57f20c67` | The request involves resuming a specific export process ('logic export v2') and incorporating code extracts into it. This indicates a functionality beyond existing commands like 'dev' or 'engineer'. It suggests a tailored process for handling exports with code integration, which necessitates a new command to encapsulate this logic. | export, resume, code integration, logic, version control |
| `920e5d41` | The request describes a specific action related to resuming a 'logic export' process and incorporating code extracts into it. This functionality does not directly map to any of the existing commands, which are broader in scope (engineer, dev, bug, plan, brainstorm, review, meta, wipe, clide, diff, document, analyze_logs). The user is asking for the system to continue a previous 'logic export' with added functionality, suggesting a distinct, new process. | logic export, resume, code integration, data export, version control |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `resume` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement a 'resume' command that allows users to continue a previously started workflow or task, restoring its state and context.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `f4283ace` | The request 'resume' does not match any of the existing commands. It suggests a desire to pick up where a previous task or workflow left off. This is a potentially useful and reusable function, suggesting a new command. | workflow, persistence, state, continue |
| `1e7aebb6` | The command 'resume' is not in the existing command list. It implies a functionality to pause, save, and later resume a workflow or task. This is a potentially reusable and valuable feature, meriting a NEW_COMMAND classification. While some commands might save state, 'resume' suggests a dedicated function to pick up where something left off. | workflow, persistence, state management, checkpoint |
| `bbd5c552` | The existing commands do not include functionality to resume a previously interrupted or paused process or workflow. 'resume' as a command would allow the user to continue a task they previously stopped, which would be a valuable addition to the CLIDE toolkit. It implies a capability to persist and recall state. | workflow, persistence, state, interrupt, pause |
| `32b70a7a` | The request 'implement' is a generic instruction to create something. While 'dev' implements features, 'implement' by itself suggests a broader functionality than just feature implementation. It doesn't exactly match any existing command, suggesting a new, potentially reusable task. | implementation, development, code, execution |
| `14534544` | The user is requesting to "implement" something. While "dev" handles feature implementation, a generic "implement" command could be used for various implementation tasks, potentially acting as a higher-level dispatcher or a more versatile implementation tool than just "dev". The existing commands focus on specific workflows, and this could be a more generalized version. | implementation, code, development |
| `c5a2606a` | The user likely wants to resume a previous session or task. There is no existing command to accomplish this, so it would represent a new reusable tool. | session, persistence, workflow, state |
| `a74e7c57` | The user is likely asking to resume a previously paused or stopped task or workflow. This functionality doesn't exist as a standalone command among the existing ones. | workflow, resume, task_management, persistence |
| `d846f6d0` | The request "do another pass" implies repeating a previous operation, which doesn't directly match any of the existing commands. It suggests a desire to re-execute the last command or a specific command, potentially with slight modifications or additional context. This functionality isn't covered by the existing command set, so it represents a new, potentially reusable task. | re-execute, repeat, iteration, history, workflow |
| `d846f6d0` | The user is requesting a command to "implement" something, which suggests they want to execute a feature implementation. While "dev" executes the 'Feature Implementation Workflow', it's likely the user's intent is a simpler, more direct implementation command. Thus, a NEW_COMMAND is appropriate. | feature, implementation, development |
| `887b0852` | The user is requesting a command related to implementation, but none of the existing commands are a direct match. The 'dev' command is related to feature implementation, but a simple 'implement' command could potentially handle various implementation tasks beyond just feature implementation, making it a valuable new tool. | implementation, code, development |
| `e4eabf80` | The command 'resume' isn't among the existing commands, but implies a useful, reusable function for CLIDE: to pick up from a previously interrupted task or save/restore state.  It's generic enough to apply across various workflows. | workflow, persistence, state, interruption, save, restore |
| `817000bf` | The user likely wants to resume a previously paused or interrupted workflow or task. This functionality isn't directly represented by any of the existing commands. | workflow, persistence, state, resume |
| `458e31b9` | The command 'resume' does not exist in the current list. It implies the action of resuming a previously paused or interrupted task or workflow, which would be a useful and reusable function. It could potentially be implemented to load a saved state and continue execution. | workflow, pause, resume, state, execution |
| `f796631e` | The user is requesting the implementation of recommendations. There is no existing command that explicitly handles the implementation of recommendations. This seems like a clear, potentially reusable task/tool. | implementation, recommendations, feature, dev |
| `10a96cfc` | The command 'resume' does not match any of the existing commands. It suggests the need for functionality to either continue a previous workflow/task or to summarize the current state of ongoing processes within the CLIDE environment. This is a potentially reusable task. | workflow, state, persistence, context |
| `70eee2ec` | The user likely wants to resume a previous task or workflow. This isn't an existing command, but is a common and reusable functionality. | workflow, persistence, state, checkpoint |
| `e4eabf80` | The user likely intended to type "resume" which is a plausible, albeit misspelled, command that doesn't exist in the current list. Assuming they want to resume a paused or interrupted task or process is a reasonable interpretation.  This could be a useful command to add. | workflow, resume, process, interrupt, pause |
| `c7bc9ff1` | The user typed "resune" which is likely a misspelling of "resume". This implies a request to generate or access a resume, a function not currently offered by the existing commands. It represents a potentially useful and reusable task. | resume, job application, career |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `break` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement a 'break' command to interrupt the current operation or execution of a command.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `1e7aebb6` | The user likely wants to interrupt or stop the current process or execution. There is no existing command to handle this specific interrupt functionality. While 'wipe' resets the entire context, 'break' would ideally interrupt the current process or the execution of a command. It suggests a need to halt the system currently engaged in operations. | interrupt, halt, cancel, stop, execution |
| `f1c01780` | The user is requesting a 'repeat' command, which is not among the existing commands. While the intent isn't fully clear without context, it strongly suggests a desire to execute a previous command again, likely the most recently executed one. This could be a useful, reusable functionality. | command, repeat, history |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `settings` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Create a 'settings' command to manage CLIDE's configuration.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `f4283ace` | The user is requesting a 'settings' command, which is not in the list of available commands. This suggests a desire to configure or modify the system's behavior or parameters. It is a reusable tool. | configuration, preferences, system, parameters |
| `e4eabf80` | The user is requesting a way to work on both Console UI (CUI) and Text-based UI (TUI) concurrently or in relation to each other. No existing command addresses this directly. It seems like a potentially useful new workflow related to UI development. | ui, cui, tui, development, console, text-based |
| `f1f98790` | The user is likely requesting a command that creates or manages both a console user interface (UI) and a text-based user interface (TUI). This is a specific development task that doesn't match any of the existing commands. | ui, tui, console, development, frontend |
| `7d59cd5f` | The user wants a demonstration of the existing libraries (ascii, animation, hi-res graphs within a TUI). There is no 'demonstrate' command currently. This suggests a need for a reusable function that can show examples of the available libraries and features. | demonstration, libraries, ascii, animation, tui, hi-res graphs, example |
| `39efc7fe` | The user is expressing frustration with the lack of a default UI library with basic functionalities and suggesting a way to configure the TUI (Text-Based User Interface). This suggests a need for a new command specifically designed to handle UI configuration, making it easier to customize the interface. | UI, TUI, configuration, default library, navigation, file selection |
| `39efc7fe` | The user is expressing frustration about the difficulty of configuring a TUI, specifically regarding navigation and file selection, and suggesting the incorporation of a default library with this functionality. This indicates a need for a new command or functionality to simplify TUI configuration, potentially involving pre-built libraries or modules. No existing command directly addresses this need. | tui, configuration, navigation, file selection, library, default, easy setup |
| `bf2e5a00` | The request '/settings' does not match any existing command. It likely refers to a function to adjust system or application settings which would be a valuable and reusable tool. | settings, configuration, preferences |
| `0b5b4372` | The user is requesting a specific change to the user interface, which doesn't match any existing command. This implies a new tool or functionality to reconfigure the GUI. | GUI, reconfiguration, tabs, toggle button, distribution modes, linear subtypes |
| `a0c9208e` | This request is asking for a way to customize the final report, which is not covered by any of the existing commands. It requires changes to the report generation logic to adjust layout, content, and detail level. | report, customization, layout, metrics, aggregates |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `restart_process` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Request to implement a 'restart_process' command that allows users to rerun a previous command with modified parameters, specifically the 'codebase investigators max turns' parameter.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `f4283ace` | The user wants to restart a process, likely a previously executed command with modified parameters. This functionality is not covered by the existing command list, which focuses on initiating specific workflows or analysis tasks. The request implies a need to modify and rerun a past process. This is a new and useful command. | restart, process, history, modification, execution |
| `e4eabf80` | The user is requesting the implementation of a feature related to rate limiting with configurable delay values, which doesn't match any of the existing commands. This is a reusable task that can be encapsulated into a command. | rate limiting, delay, configuration, config.ini, implementation, feature |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `explain` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Explain [CONCEPT]: Provides a detailed explanation of a given concept or term.  Focuses on clarity and accessibility.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `f4283ace` | The user is asking for an explanation of a concept ('marshmallow'). There isn't an existing command that directly addresses this. A new command to explain a concept would be useful and reusable. | explanation, concept, knowledge |
| `1e7aebb6` | The request asks for an explanation of a topic (Marshmallow). This doesn't match any existing command but is a potentially reusable function. A new command 'explain' could be created to provide explanations or summaries of terms, technologies, etc. | explain, definition, summary, knowledge |
| `e4eabf80` | The request asks to explain 'c' more, implying a desire for a command that provides detailed explanations. It also includes 'a and b', which suggests the ability to include topics to be explained.  None of the existing commands directly provide this functionality. | explanation, clarification, documentation |
| `f1f98790` | The user is requesting an explanation of 'c', and possibly also wants to perform tasks 'a' and 'b' which are unclear.  However, the key is the request for more detailed explanation, which doesn't map cleanly to any of the existing commands. A new command to `explain` a concept or file or output would be useful. The 'a and b' part is likely either context for the explain command, or will be handled by subsequent commands. | explanation, documentation, context |
| `e4eabf80` | The request is asking for an explanation of 'c', implying the C programming language. This doesn't match any existing command, but 'explain' is a reasonable and potentially reusable command for educational purposes or clarifying technical concepts. | C programming, explanation, clarification, education |
| `70e4cbad` | The user is asking for an explanation of 'c', which implies a need for a command that can explain programming concepts or code. There isn't a command that directly supports explaining a concept like this. | explanation, programming, C, education |
| `bcd23245` | The user is asking for an explanation of something, abbreviated as 'gep'. This indicates a desire for a command that can explain a given term or concept. None of the existing commands provide this functionality directly. While 'review' or 'document' could potentially relate, the core intent is explanation, suggesting a new command. | explanation, definition, knowledge, understanding |
| `e4eabf80` | The user is asking for an explanation of the current output, which is a new task.  There isn't an existing command that does this. The typo "ordet" is assumed to be "order". | explanation, output, interpretation, order |
| `f796631e` | The user wants a new functionality to explain the current output, which doesn't match any of the existing commands. This is a reusable task, as it could be applied to any output from any command. | output, explanation, interpretation, CLI |
| `e4eabf80` | The user is asking for a conceptual description of the program's functionality, geared toward someone who wants to remake it. This doesn't perfectly align with any of the existing commands. While `review` touches upon knowledge review, this is more about creating a description for an external audience rather than reviewing existing knowledge. `document` is closer but emphasizes comprehensive documentation, whereas this request is specifically focused on a 'conceptual' and 'non-technical' explanation. Therefore, a new command is needed. | documentation, conceptual description, api, functionality, remake, non-technical |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `remove_cognitive_load` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Remove legacy redundant cognitive load. This likely involves identifying sources of cognitive overload in the system, such as complex code, poor documentation, or convoluted processes, and implementing changes to reduce them.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `1e7aebb6` | This request describes a task that isn't covered by existing commands. It implies a process of identifying and removing elements that contribute to cognitive overload, which could involve code refactoring, simplifying designs, or improving documentation.  While 'engineer' or 'meta' might touch on this, they don't directly address the specific goal of cognitive load reduction. | cognitive load, refactoring, simplification, optimization, developer experience |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `find_free_proxies` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement a tool to find and validate free proxies for use in asynchronous tasks to avoid IP bans.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `resource_allocation` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Allocate available proxies to a specified number of workers.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bbd5c552` | The user is requesting a resource allocation strategy. They have a certain number of proxies and want to distribute work across a specified number of workers. This functionality doesn't exist in the current command set but is a valuable and reusable task. | resource allocation, proxies, workers, optimization, parallel processing |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `analyze_success_rate` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Analyze the success rate of attempts against a list of usernames or phone numbers.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `f4283ace` | The user is analyzing a success rate and providing a list of usernames (potentially scrubbed phone numbers). This doesn't fit any existing command. A new command to analyze success rates, especially related to username/phone number attempts, would be useful. The command should take a success rate and a list of potential usernames as input. | success rate, analysis, usernames, phone numbers, security, automation |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `phone_number_check` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement a command to check a list of phone numbers against specified criteria (e.g., validity, existence in a database, etc.) and report the success rate.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bbd5c552` | The user is expressing concern about a low success rate and providing a list of phone numbers. This implies they are attempting some action involving these phone numbers and experiencing failure. This could be a distinct function like checking if the provided phone numbers are valid or if they exist in a database. A general command to check a list of phone numbers for validity or other criteria is useful. | phone_number, validation, success_rate, bulk_check |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `research` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Suggest or perform research on activities to fill 1-2 hours.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bbd5c552` | The user is asking what to do for 1 to 2 hours. This implies a need for research or finding suitable activities to fill that time. This doesn't directly match any existing command, but a command that could perform research or suggest activities would be useful and reusable. | time management, activity suggestion, research |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `scrape_facebook` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement a tool to scrape and analyze public posts from Facebook groups to identify new potential website examples/extensions.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `f4283ace` | The user wants to extract data from Facebook public posts to discover new 'sitex' (likely meaning site extensions or site examples). This requires a specific tool/command to scrape and analyze Facebook data, which is not currently offered by any existing command.  It's more than a simple discovery task, and has a clear utility. | facebook, scraping, data extraction, public posts, sitex, analysis |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `format_logs` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Create a new command to scrape public posts from Facebook groups to identify specific keywords or patterns.  The command should take the Facebook group name(s) and the target keyword(s) as input.  Output should be a structured dataset of relevant posts, including post text, timestamp, author, and any identified keyword matches.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bbd5c552` | The user wants to scrape data from Facebook public group posts to find 'sitex' (likely a website or term). No existing command handles social media scraping. This is a potentially reusable function. | social media, scraping, facebook, data mining, sitex |
| `bbd5c552` | The user is requesting an action that does not directly map to an existing command. It suggests an automated login to a social media platform. This could be a reusable tool. | social_media, login, automation, credentials |
| `32b70a7a` | This request describes a specific log formatting behavior that is not covered by the existing commands.  It requires parsing and manipulating log output, which `analyze_logs` might do, but not in the way requested. A new command is needed to encapsulate this functionality. | logs, formatting, output, parsing, site, url |
| `94e57288` | The user is requesting a specific formatting behavior for log entries, which isn't covered by the existing commands. This could be a reusable tool for log processing. | logs, formatting, parsing, display |
| `94e57288` | The request asks for formatting logs for readability, removing redundancy, and clustering logs by site. This constitutes a new, useful command focused on log processing. While 'analyze_logs' exists, it focuses on debugging and context extraction, not primarily formatting and clustering. | logs, formatting, redundancy, clustering, site, readability |
| `32b70a7a` | The user wants to further cluster data and eliminate redundancy from log events, even if it means showing out-of-sync events. This suggests a specific log analysis task that goes beyond the current 'analyze_logs' command in terms of clustering strength and tolerance for minor inaccuracies for the sake of reduced redundancy. It requires a new tool/command dedicated to this type of log analysis. | logs, clustering, redundancy, data analysis, synchronization |
| `11144674` | The user wants to change how the CLIDE presents information. They want a command to condense log output, group related events, and present them in a more user-friendly way. This is a new feature request, and doesn't fit into any existing command's functionality. It implies a tool or script to reformat and reorganize event logs. | logs, condense, events, display, formatting, output, sequence |
| `32b70a7a` | The user is requesting a way to condense and format the provided log output for better readability, which is a reusable tool. The analysis of the log indicates that the program attempts to extract raw bonuses and retries credentials. The desired output should be more concise than the presented log. | logs, formatting, condense, data analysis, audgo |
| `11144674` | The user wants a tool to condense and format the log output for better readability. This is a distinct task that isn't covered by existing commands. | logs, formatting, readability, condense, summarize |
| `32b70a7a` | The user wants to see a demonstration of a 'condensed logging output'. This implies a new command or functionality to summarize or filter logs for a more concise view.  No existing command directly addresses this. | logs, logging, output, condensed, demonstration |
| `f1f98790` | The user is asking to find lists of people that are posted on websites. This is a clear and potentially reusable task. None of the existing commands cover this specific functionality. It requires a new command to extract and organize such information. | list, people, sites, extraction, web, scraping |
| `e4eabf80` | The user request 'crashed' implies a problem that needs debugging. While 'analyze_logs' exists, a dedicated 'debug' command that can, for example, start by analyzing logs and then allow further debugging steps would be useful. | debugging, crash, error, troubleshooting, logs |
| `e4eabf80` | The user is requesting a feature to generate two-line versions of something. This is not a match for any of the existing commands and sounds like a potentially useful and reusable functionality. | formatting, versioning, summary |
| `f796631e` | The user is requesting a new command that likely involves generating versions or summaries that are concise (two lines). This doesn't match any existing command and represents a potentially reusable feature. | summarization, versioning, concise, formatting |
| `10a96cfc` | The user wants to eliminate password requirements, which is a new functionality not covered by existing commands. While it could fall under `engineer`, it's a distinct goal worthy of its own command. | security, authentication, passwordless, ux, access control |
| `c0677432` | The user is requesting a specific action: to extract text from a screenshot of a website. This is a potentially reusable function, and there isn't an existing command that directly addresses it. It combines web scraping (taking a screenshot) and OCR (extracting text). | web scraping, OCR, text extraction, screenshot |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `test` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement a command `test_discovery_agent` to thoroughly test the discovery agent's functionality and performance.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bbd5c552` | The request clearly expresses the need for a testing mechanism specifically for the 'discovery agent'. This doesn't fall under any existing command. It is a potentially reusable task. | testing, discovery, agent, automation |
| `7fecf549` | The user is asking if all systems are functional, which implies a desire to run tests or health checks. No existing command explicitly addresses system-wide testing. | testing, health check, system, functional |
| `dc0d797c` | The user is asking for a verification of whether a specific process (applying mappings) has been completed across a set of files. This is a task that the existing commands do not directly address. It necessitates checking the state of files against applied mappings. This sounds like a reusable tool to check if certain actions (in this case, applying a mapping) have been applied to a set of files. | mapping, verification, files, status, automation |
| `dc0d797c` | The user is asking to verify if a specific process (applying mappings to files) has been completed. This isn't covered by the existing commands. It requires a new tool or function to check the status of the mappings and their application to the files. | verification, mapping, files, status, automation |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `search_facebook` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement a command `facebook_search` to search for content on Facebook based on user-provided keywords or criteria.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |

**Primary Definition:** *Implement a command for interacting with Facebook groups, potentially including functionality for posting, scraping data, and joining/leaving groups.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `f4283ace` | The user is asking the system to interact with Facebook groups, which is not covered by the existing commands. This seems like a task that could be generalized and reused as a new command for automating actions within Facebook groups (e.g., posting, scraping, etc.). The typo 'yo' instead of 'go' seems to indicate an attempt to instruct the system to take action on Facebook groups. | facebook, group, automation, social media |
| `bbd5c552` | The request "you need to yo to facebook grouos" is interpreted as a request to interact with Facebook groups. This functionality does not directly correspond to any of the existing commands. It represents a new task or tool that could be useful. | facebook, groups, social media, automation |
| `f4283ace` | The user is requesting the creation of a tool that extracts data from Facebook. This is a specific task not covered by the existing commands. While "engineer" could be used eventually, the user's intent is to *design* such a tool, implying a unique workflow for data extraction from Facebook specifically. | facebook, data extraction, api, scraping, social media |
| `bbd5c552` | The user wants to create a new tool for extracting data from Facebook. This is a distinct, reusable task that doesn't match any existing commands. | facebook, data extraction, tool, API, social media |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `provide_code` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *User offers to provide code.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bbd5c552` | The user is offering to provide code, which suggests a potential new command to handle code submission or input. This doesn't directly match any existing commands, but represents a reusable action that could be valuable. Although the prompt is terse, code provision is a common part of the development process. | code, input, submission, snippet |
| `f1f98790` | The request implies extending a duration by 12 hours. This could be a useful, repeatable function, perhaps related to scheduling or deadlines. It's not an exact match for any existing command, but is a general purpose extension of time. | time, duration, extend, schedule, deadline |
| `b4968acd` | The request describes a specific task: correcting articles based on length criteria. No existing command directly addresses this. It could potentially involve multiple steps, making it reusable. | article correction, content editing, length constraint, batch processing |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `manual_cooko3` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Develop a manual cooko3 method that can be executed using only a phone and either Kiwi browser or inspector.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bbd5c552` | The user is requesting a specific action (the 'manual cooko3 method') and mentions limitations ('only have a phone') and tools ('kiwi browser or inspector'). This suggests a need for a procedure or workflow that can be executed with these constraints. Since there's no existing command for a 'cooko3' method, this seems like a request for a new command to be created. | cooko3, manual, phone, kiwi browser, inspector, workflow, mobile |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `tail_log` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Create a command `tail_log` that takes a filename as an argument and executes `tail -f <filename>` in the background, displaying the output to the user.  The command should be interruptible and clean up its background process on exit.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bbd5c552` | The user is attempting to run `tail -f scraper_run.log` which is a common command for monitoring a log file in real-time. This functionality doesn't directly map to any of the existing commands, and would be a useful addition to the CLIDE, especially for debugging and monitoring running processes. | logs, monitoring, debugging, tail, real-time |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `default_tail` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Create a command to set the default number of lines shown by the 'tail' functionality. This could be named 'default_tail' or 'set_default_tail_lines'.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bbd5c552` | The user is requesting a new command that would set the 'tail' behavior (likely the number of lines shown) to be the default. This is a feature request for the system itself and doesn't match any existing command. The misspellings also don't let us match an existing command. | default, tail, configuration, user interface |

| `a0c9208e` | The request implies a desire to push code changes to a Git repository. This is a common development task, but there isn't an existing command to directly handle it. Creating a dedicated 'git_push' command would allow the system to automate this task, potentially incorporating commit message standardization, branch handling, and remote selection. | git, version control, push, code management, automation |
| `7f0c4cbc` | The request "push to repo plz" implies pushing code changes to a version control repository, which is a common task that doesn't have a corresponding command in the existing list. While `diff` handles code evolution, it doesn't address the actual process of pushing changes to a remote repository. Thus, a new command is needed to handle this functionality. | version control, git, push, repository |
| `183bccd2` | The request "push to repo plz" strongly suggests the need for a command to push changes to a repository. This functionality is common in software development workflows but doesn't directly map to any of the existing commands. While 'dev' might eventually involve pushing, this request is more direct and warrants its own command. | git, repository, push, version control |
| `7f0c4cbc` | The command 'pull' is a common operation in version control systems (like Git) and is used to retrieve and merge changes from a remote repository. It's a fundamental software development task and doesn't currently have a direct match in the existing commands. The existing commands focus on higher-level workflows and code analysis. | version control, git, repository, update, merge |
| `183bccd2` | The user wants to 'pull' from a repository, which is a common Git operation. While the existing commands provide high-level functionalities, none directly address basic Git commands like 'pull'. This suggests a new command for retrieving changes from a remote repository is needed. | git, repository, remote, update, version control |

| `e4eabf80` | The request seems to provide data (in a tabular format) and the beginning of a complaint ('its chinese charact3ta insyead wtf'). It implies a need to analyze or interpret this data, likely to identify patterns or errors. Existing commands like 'analyze_logs' are similar but focus on logs, while this seems to be more general data analysis related to character encoding/representation issues. Therefore, it warrants a new command. | data analysis, character encoding, utf-8, data validation, data integrity |

**COMMAND:** `` `emoji_permissions_table` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Check utilities for emoji permissions and generate a Markdown table of the results.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `e4eabf80` | The user is asking to check utilities and generate emoji permissions, then format the output as a Markdown table. This is a specific task that could be useful again, but does not match any of the existing commands. It's not a fact, discovery, lesson, or niche request.  It is a request to perform a new task, not just a modification of an existing workflow. 'util and gen emoji perms' implies checking some utility or utilities. 'make it output to an md table' indicates generating an output in markdown table format. | emoji, permissions, utilities, markdown, table, output, generation |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `configure_column_display` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Allow CLIDE output configuration via customizable column codes and/or the number of columns and a sequence of emoji.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `e4eabf80` | The user is requesting the ability to customize the column display, specifically via column codes and emoji sequences. This is a new feature that does not match any of the existing commands. The request implies a configurable aspect of the CLIDE's output formatting, which can be useful in various contexts. | configuration, CLIDE, customization, column_display, emoji |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `meta` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Add an 'html' output flag and abbreviate all command-line flags to 1 character.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `e4eabf80` | The user is requesting modifications to the system, specifically the addition of a new output flag and a change to flag abbreviations. This falls under the domain of System Instruction Revision, which is handled by the 'meta' command. While it doesn't perfectly map to the request, it's the closest existing command that would be responsible for such changes to the system's core functionality. | cli, flags, output, abbreviation, system |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `rename_fields` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement a '--help' and '-h' option for all commands to display usage instructions.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `62ca1c0e` | The user is requesting the addition of a help option (likely to display command usage) to the CLIDE. This is a standard feature for command-line interfaces and does not currently exist in the list of commands. It's a reusable and necessary tool. | cli, help, usage, option |
| `f1c01780` | The user is requesting a very specific visual pattern generation, which is not covered by any existing command. This looks like a distinct tool for creating visual elements based on specific criteria. | visual, pattern, color, generation, data visualization |
| `415c8eed` | The request involves multiple steps: expanding the data model, generating update prompts, and generating instructions for building a RAG system. This doesn't fit into any existing command. While 'meta' is close, it only addresses updating system instructions, not schema expansion or RAG setup. This requires a more complex, multi-step process that is more than just a simple knowledge review or system instruction revision. The scope and interconnectedness of the tasks necessitate a new command. | schema, data model, relational vectors, updatemeta, update manifest, update graph, RAG, instructions, Windows 11, WSL, Ubuntu, ZSH |
| `e4eabf80` | The user wants to rename fields, which isn't covered by the existing commands. It sounds like a potentially useful command for data manipulation or schema refactoring. | rename, fields, data, schema, refactor |
| `54894cbd` | The user is requesting a data transformation task that doesn't directly map to existing commands.  It requires renaming fields based on abbreviations, which implies a structured data manipulation capability. This could be a useful utility for working with databases or data structures within the CLIDE environment. | data transformation, rename fields, abbreviations, data manipulation, database |
| `e4eabf80` | The user wants to add a 'help' argument to the main script, which suggests a new command to display help information about the available commands or options. This isn't covered by existing commands. | cli, help, argument, usage, documentation |
| `905a6964` | The user wants a new tool to clean and restructure their root directory with multiple clarification stages and a final confirmation. No existing command directly addresses this complex interactive cleanup process. | filesystem, cleanup, restructure, automation, interactive, confirmation |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `sequence_input` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement a mechanism for interactive input where, if no flags are specified, the user is prompted to fill all required fields sequentially.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `e4eabf80` | This request describes a desired functionality: interactive input with no pre-set flags. It implies a mode where the user is prompted for all available fields or parameters, likely for a command that normally accepts flags or arguments directly. No existing command directly matches this. | interactive, input, fields, flags, prompt |
| `62ca1c0e` | The user is describing a scenario where, if no flags (presumably command-line flags) are given, a user should be able to sequentially input data into all required fields. This suggests a new type of input mechanism that isn't covered by the existing commands. It's a clear, reusable task/tool. | input, flag, sequence, user_interface |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `pattern` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement functionality to define and use custom patterns.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `e4eabf80` | The user is requesting the ability to define custom patterns, which suggests a new functionality for the CLIDE. No existing command directly addresses the need to define or use custom patterns for any purpose. | pattern, customization, regex, search |
| `62ca1c0e` | The user is requesting a new capability - to allow custom patterns. This does not match any existing command and seems to be a potentially useful, reusable feature. | customization, patterns, flexibility, configuration |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `index_map` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Define 'index map'. Explain its purpose, structure, and common use cases.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `e4eabf80` | The user is asking for a definition of 'index map'. This suggests a command to explain or generate such a map would be useful. It doesn't match any existing commands. | index, map, data structure, definition, explanation |
| `62ca1c0e` | The user is asking for a definition of 'index map'. There isn't an existing command to provide a definition of technical terms. This would be a reusable tool. | definition, index, map, technical |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `encode_sequence` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *The user request describes an encoding scheme where numerical sequences are mapped to sequences of colored squares. The colors are assigned based on the digits in the sequence. For example, '1' maps to red (🟥), '2' maps to orange (🟧), '3' maps to yellow (🟨), and '4' maps to green (🟩). The order of the digits in the sequence determines the order of the colors in the output sequence. The encoding of '111' is '🟥🟥🟥🟧🟧🟧🟨🟨🟨🟩🟩🟩', encoding each number for each color. The encoding of '21' is '🟥🟥  🟥🟧  🟥🟨  🟥🟩  🟧🟥  🟧🟧  🟧🟨  🟧🟩  🟨🟥  🟨🟧  🟨🟨 🟨🟩  🟩🟥  🟩🟧  🟩🟨  🟩🟩', and so on. Implement this encoding as `encode_sequence <input_sequence>`, with color order Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, allowing sequences of digits between 1 and 4. Spacing between digit encodings is important for readability.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `e4eabf80` | The user is describing a new encoding scheme where numerical sequences map to sequences of colored squares. This could be generalized into a reusable tool. The user provides examples and asks if the logic makes sense, implying a desire for this logic to be implemented somewhere. | encoding, sequence, color, mapping, visualization |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `format_delimiter` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Create a command `format_delimiter` that takes a string and a delimiter as input and outputs the string formatted with the specified delimiter separating the data into columns. For example: `format_delimiter "123,321" ,` should result in "123 321" (or a representation thereof), and `format_delimiter "123-321" -` should also result in "123 321".*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `e4eabf80` | The user wants a new tool to format data based on a specific delimiter. This is a potentially reusable task, warranting a new command. No existing command addresses delimiter-based formatting explicitly. | delimiter, formatting, data, columns |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `parameter_tuning` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement a command to define minimum and maximum percentage parameters for relevant CLIDE functions.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `e4eabf80` | The request implies a need to adjust parameters related to minimum and maximum percentages, suggesting a command that allows for fine-tuning or configuration. None of the existing commands cover this functionality. | parameter, tuning, configuration, percentage, min, max |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `define_percentage_range` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Allow defining a minimum and maximum percentage value/range.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `62ca1c0e` | The user is requesting the ability to define a minimum and maximum percentage. This functionality doesn't directly map to any existing commands. It implies a new capability related to setting constraints or parameters, potentially for data analysis, configuration, or validation. | percentage, range, min, max, configuration, parameter |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `parse` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Create a command `parse` that allows parsing two data inputs together with default values of 0 and 100 for unspecified parameters.  The command should handle combined processing of the inputs.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `62ca1c0e` | The request "parse both together and default 0 100" suggests a new command, potentially for parsing data with options for combined processing and default values. No existing command seems to fulfill this specific parsing requirement with default parameter handling. | parsing, data, default, options, utility |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `emoji_increment` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Enable a system to generate emoji sequences where a portion of the sequence (e.g., 'b1' in '321b1') increments with each iteration.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `e4eabf80` | The user is requesting a new functionality related to emoji sequences and incrementing parts of the sequence. This is not covered by any existing command. | emoji, sequence, increment, customization |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `compare` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Compare 'b321' and 'b3b2b1' and explain the differences.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `e4eabf80` | The user is asking for a comparison between two things, 'b321' and 'b3b2b1'. This doesn't directly map to any of the existing commands. A new command dedicated to comparing would be beneficial. The user is probably asking to compare similar items (like software versions, configurations, or similar data) and understand their differences. | comparison, difference, analysis |
| `dc0d797c` | The user wants to compare the size of something to other things. This is a reusable task that doesn't fall under any of the existing commands. It could potentially leverage existing analysis or information gathering tools, but the core functionality of comparative analysis based on size or other attributes is missing. | comparison, size, attributes, analysis |
| `bf2e5a00` | The request asks for a comparison of two things, including pros and cons. This is a common task that isn't covered by any of the existing commands. A dedicated 'compare' command could take two inputs and provide a detailed comparison. | comparison, pros, cons, analysis |
| `bc663143` | The user wants a detailed comparison of two (unspecified) things, including pros and cons. This doesn't directly match any existing command, but it's a common and reusable task to have the system perform a comparative analysis. | comparison, pros, cons, analysis |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `compare_versions` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Compare and contrast the versions 'b321' and 'b3b2b1'. Consider semantic versioning if applicable. Investigate if they are commit hashes, and compare code associated with them if appropriate.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `62ca1c0e` | The user wants a comparison between two seemingly similar version strings. No existing command fulfills this. This is a generalizable task. | versioning, comparison, semantic, code |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `modal` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Create a modal window or dialog in the user interface.  Specify title, content, and any necessary buttons.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
