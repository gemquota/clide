| "have telemetry and network next to each other and have Health Status just say Health and have 4 lines, bad. okay. good. great. also there are some extraneous [/ throughout and can you make the finalization report more detailed including metrics for the run and aggregates/historical" | The user is requesting a modification to the format and content of a report (likely the finalization report). This is a distinct, reusable task that doesn't fall under building a completely new tool, but rather extending or customizing existing report generation capabilities.  The requested changes are specific to the report format and content (Telemetry/Network adjacency, Health status simplification, Health status values, extraneous character removal, and report detail increase with metrics and aggregates). |

| "oh my god thats all I wanted just the smooth and stepped and being able to add or remove steps and 18 doesnt need to be a cap" | The user is describing desired functionality related to controlling 'steps' in some process, including making it smooth, stepped, adding/removing steps, and increasing the limit beyond 18. This suggests a command that manipulates a process or system involving discrete steps, rather than a specific engineering task, bug fix, or planning activity handled by the existing commands. It's not a general-purpose tool intent, but a more specific tool to control steps. |

It implies the need to perhaps refactor, simplify, or decompose a component, system, or code base. This qualifies as a new, higher-level behavioral command.  It could be extended to handle other contexts than just "steel". |
