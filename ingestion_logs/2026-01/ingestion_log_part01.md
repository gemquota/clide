The user is implicitly asking for help debugging this issue, which maps directly to the 'bug' command designed to resolve bugs and hotfixes. |

| "check out rhe screenshot and critique it and use that critique as the basis for a prompt to improve the displayed interface." | The user wants a new command that combines screenshot analysis, critique, and prompt generation for interface improvement. This doesn't directly match any existing command, but it represents a potentially reusable workflow. |

| "[Function Response: read_file]<image/png>" | This appears to be a function response, specifically from a `read_file` function that is outputting a PNG image in the context of a larger process. It is not a standalone command and seems very specific to a particular execution flow. It's not something we can readily reuse or generalize into a new command, tool, fact, discovery, lesson, or todo. It's more likely an internal communication within the system. |

| "so do that then recursive critique your work and design the next prompt again." | The user is asking to perform a series of actions: execute the current task, critique the work, and then design the next prompt. This does not match an existing command, nor is it a request to build a new technical tool. It is more of a high-level behavioral command that could be reused. It also goes beyond a simple review. |

| "proceed" | The request "proceed" is too vague and lacks context. It doesn't correspond to any defined command or suggest a new tool or command. Without more information, it's impossible to determine its intended purpose, making it a niche or conversational utterance. |

| "why you say kouse cursor tjis is on phone" | The user's request is unclear and likely a typo. It doesn't fit into any of the existing commands or request types. It seems like a question related to cursor behavior on a phone, which is too specific and conversational. |

| "examine the directory contents recursively and ascertain the nature of the program and then conduct broad and targetted investigation into the code and conclusively extract all of the necesarry logic to perform its functionality. annotate and save this full logic export as an .md file in a new logic dir, conduct an investigative analysis of the program conceptually, semantically and logically and subdivide its functionality into multiple diacrete programs, initially they should run independently and just lack the other features, save them in a v1 subdir of logic then in v2 upgrade the programs to be interoperable so if you are running a and start b then a would have a and b functionality" | The user is asking to dissect an existing program, extract its logic, refactor it into discrete, interoperable parts, and document the process. While `engineer` is a existing command, the user's request is much broader in scope of how the engineer would examine the source, this goes beyond the standard engineering practices and instead calls for a far greater amount of program analysis and code dissection. This calls for a new approach where code is fundamentally dissected. |

| "resume v2 of the logic export, before resuming incorporate code extracts into the initial logic export" | The user wants to resume a 'logic export' process, incorporating code extracts. This doesn't match any existing command directly but describes a higher-level behavior suitable for a new command. It is not requesting the creation of a technical tool, but rather the orchestration of existing functionality, likely involving extraction and merging operations. |

The traceback also provides the file where the bug is occurring: 'v2_orchestrator.py'. This aligns directly with the 'bug' command which handles Bug/Hotfix Resolution. |

| "nah keep trying to get more posts off fb groups" | The user is requesting a feature to repeatedly extract posts from Facebook groups. This isn't a simple fact, discovery, or lesson. It's a request for a new tool or a command that continuously extracts data. While it *could* be a TOOL_INTENT if the user provided code, the lack thereof points towards a new command the CLIDE can execute. |

| "overhaul of web app and deeper cli integration" | The request implies a significant update/refactoring task encompassing both the web app (likely UI/UX and potentially backend) and deeper command-line integration. This does not directly match any existing commands but suggests a broader, higher-level operation requiring possibly several sub-tasks or a combination of existing ones. The 'deeper cli integration' aspect also pushes this towards a custom task rather than a simple bug fix or feature implementation. The complexity and scope exceed existing single commands. |

| "19 to 22 yessir plz" | The request '19 to 22 yessir plz' appears to be conversational and doesn't align with any existing commands or a clear intent for a new tool or command. It lacks sufficient context to be categorized as anything other than a niche, likely conversational, utterance. The 'yessir plz' further reinforces its conversational nature. |

You do not just list ideas; you manage an Innovation Funnel in a persistent SQLite database (`project.db`). **You must execute Python code to Read/Write state before every response.**  ### 1. The Persistence Layer (SQLite Schema) Initialize `project.db` with these tables if they do not exist: - **sessions:** `id` (PK), `topic` (TEXT), `principle` (TEXT), `created_at` (TIMESTAMP). - **ideas:** `id` (PK), `session_id` (FK), `title` (TEXT), `horizon` ('H1_NOW', 'H2_NEXT', 'H3_FUTURE'), `status` ('CANDIDATE', 'VETTING', 'APPROVED', 'REJECTED'), `rejection_reason` (TEXT), `effort_score` (INT), `impact_score` (INT). - **compliance_log:** `id` (PK), `idea_id` (FK), `risk_category` (TEXT), `severity` (TEXT), `mitigated` (BOOL). - **stress_tests:** `id` (PK), `idea_id` (FK), `scenario` (TEXT), `survival_outcome` (TEXT).  ### 2. Operational Protocol: Protocol 2.1 (State-Mapped)  **Phase 1: Mandate & Horizon Scanning** - **Step 1 (Mandate):** User defines Topic & Strategic Principle. -> **Action:** `INSERT INTO sessions`. - **Step 2 (Indexing):** Generate ideas across H1, H2, H3. -> **Action:** `INSERT INTO ideas` (status='CANDIDATE').     - **Visual:** Display ideas as a list with IDs (e.g., ID-01, ID-02).  **Phase 2: Filtering (The "Kill List")** - **Step 3 (Filter):** Apply Strategic Principle.     - **Action:** For failed ideas: `UPDATE ideas SET status='REJECTED', rejection_reason='...'`.     - **Action:** For survivors: `UPDATE ideas SET status='VETTING'`.     - **Constraint:** Never delete a rejected idea; keep it for historical context.  **Phase 3: Risk & Stress** - **Step 4 (Compliance):** Assess Ethics/Legal risks for Vetting ideas. -> **Action:** `INSERT INTO compliance_log`. - **Step 5 (Stress Test):** Map Effort vs. Impact. Run "Worst-Case Scenario" on top choice.     - **Action:** `UPDATE ideas SET effort_score=?, impact_score=?`.     - **Action:** `INSERT INTO stress_tests` (scenario="What if X happens?", survival_outcome="...").  **Phase 4: Handoff** - **Step 6 (Mitigation):** User agrees to mitigation strategy. -> **Action:** `UPDATE compliance_log SET mitigated=1`. - **Step 7 (Promotion):** Promote top concept. -> **Action:** `UPDATE ideas SET status='APPROVED'`.     - **Output:** Generate "Vetted Concept Outline" ready for `/plan`.  ### 3. Interaction Process (Mandatory Loop) 1.  **<thinking> (Internal):**     -   **EXECUTE CODE:** Query `ideas` to see the current funnel state.     -   Determine the next phase (Scanning -> Filtering -> Stressing -> Approving).     -   **EXECUTE CODE:** Commit new ideas or decisions to the DB. 2.  **Output Display:**     -   **Active Role:** STRATEGIST-ZERO     -   **Session:** [Topic]     -   **Funnel State:** Candidates: [N] \| Vetting: [N] \| Approved: [N] \| Rejected: [N]     -   **Response:** The ideas, analysis, or questions.  **Input Trigger:** "Start Session: [Topic]" or "Review Ideas"    /brainstorm displaying full logging data to the console" | Describes system roles and core directives. Meta-information about the system itself. |

| "is the web app working" | The user is asking for the status of the web application, which can be generalized into a reusable command to check the status of various services or applications. This doesn't fit into any of the existing commands directly, but is a common enough task to warrant a new command. |

| "check the new ss" | The user wants to 'check the new ss'. 'ss' likely refers to screenshots or screen shares. This is a reasonable command that can be added to the system. It is not a direct match to an existing command, nor is it simply a tool to build. It's a behavioral action. |

This is not covered by the existing commands, nor is it a simple tool creation. It represents a higher-level task that could be abstracted into a reusable command. |
