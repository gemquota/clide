| "yep do 5.1 to 5.50 then 6.1 to 6.50" | The user wants to perform an unspecified operation on numerical ranges. This doesn't match any existing command, but it represents a potentially reusable function for applying an operation (not specified in this request, but implied) to a sequence of numerical ranges. It's not a tool in itself, but a general utility function. |

| "run the grid script and proceed to fill all blanks up to 500 then run a file size check on the first 500 and make a scatter plot with an actual graphing library, and push to git" | The user is requesting a series of actions (run grid script, fill blanks, file size check, scatter plot, push to git) which does not directly match any existing command, but it represents a logical and potentially reusable workflow. It's not a request for a specific tool to be built (TOOL_INTENT), but rather a request to perform a data processing task. |

| "proceed from articles/06_tooling_fatigue_assessment/33_chatops_implementation" | The request "proceed from articles/06_tooling_fatigue_assessment/33_chatops_implementation" doesn't match any existing commands. It also isn't a request to build a tool or a new command. It appears to be navigation related but is too specific and lacks context to determine its exact meaning. It seems to be an instruction within a specific, ongoing task, and therefore falls under the NICHE category. |

Quality \& Health Gradient (12-Step)  Used for both **Run Health** `\[RunH]` and **Proxy Health** `\[ProxyH]`. This metric uses a granular scale of shapes and colors to indicate precise quality tiers.  The logic follows a progression of **Color** (Red -> Orange -> Yellow -> Green) and **Shape** (Square -> Circle -> Heart) as quality increases.  * **For Run Health:** Based on success percentage (Higher = Better). * **For Proxy Health:** Based on inverted IP Risk Score (Lower Risk = Higher Quality = Better).  \|Range\|Symbol\|Description\|Meaning\| \|-\|:-:\|-\|-\| \|**0% - 9%**\|🟥\|Red Square\|**Critical Failure:** high risk / zero success.\| \|**10% - 19%**\|🔴\|Red Circle\|**Very Poor:** significant issues.\| \|**20% - 24%**\|❤️\|Red Heart\|**Poor:** slightly better but still critical.\| \|**25% - 34%**\|🟧\|Orange Square\|**Low:** approaching functional levels.\| \|**35% - 44%**\|🟠\|Orange Circle\|**Below Average:** frequent friction.\| \|**45% - 49%**\|🧡\|Orange Heart\|**Marginal:** nearing acceptable threshold.\| \|**50% - 59%**\|🟨\|Yellow Square\|**Fair:** functional but degraded.\| \|**60% - 69%**\|🟡\|Yellow Circle\|**Good:** standard acceptable performance.\| \|**70% - 74%**\|💛\|Yellow Heart\|**Very Good:** above average reliability.\| \|**75% - 84%**\|🟩\|Green Square\|**Excellent:** high reliability / low risk.\| \|**85% - 94%**\|🟢\|Green Circle\|**Superior:** very clean / stable.\| \|**95% - 100%**\|💚\|Green Heart\|**Perfect/Near Perfect:** optimal state.\|  ### 2\. Operational Status (✅ / ⛔)  Used for the **Status Icon** `\[StatusIcon]`. This provides a binary (Pass/Fail) visual confirmation of the specific request result.  * **✅ Check Mark:** **Success**    * *Condition:* HTTP 200 OK + Valid Data Parsed.   * *Meaning:* The specific URL was scraped, and data was extracted successfully. Corresponds to status text "DONE".  * **⛔ No Entry:** **Failure**    * *Condition:* HTTP 4xx/5xx Error, Timeout, or Ban.   * *Meaning:* The request failed. Corresponds to error codes like "E404", "E503", or "E000" (Network Error).  ### 4\. Metric Anchors (Icons)  These static icons serve as visual delimiters, allowing the user to quickly locate specific data points in the dense text grid without reading labels.  * **⏱️ (Stopwatch):** Marks the **Timing** block (Elapsed / Duration). * **💾 (Floppy Disk):** Marks the **System Memory** usage. * **🖥️ (Desktop Computer):** Marks the **CPU** usage. * **⚡ (High Voltage):** Marks the **Latency/Network Speed**. * **🚀 (Rocket):** Marks the **Throughput** (items per second). * **👷 (Construction Worker):** Marks the **Thread/Worker ID**. * **📊 (Bar Chart):** Marks the **Statistics** (Success/Fail counts). * **❌ (Cross Mark):** Marks the **Error Count** (specific error instances). * **🌐 (Globe):** Marks the **Target URL**.  ---  ## Extended \& Hypothetical Iconography (Experimental)  These symbols are used in advanced layouts to replace text labels entirely or provide secondary state information.  ### 1\. Symbolic Status Codes \& Error Mapping  Replaces the standard `E###` text codes with representative imagery for faster cognitive processing.  \|Icon\|Symbol Name\|Replaces\|Meaning\|Context/Nuance\| \|:-:\|-\|-\|-\|-\| \|🏁\|Chequered Flag\|`DONE`\|**Success**\|Request completed and data parsed perfectly.\| \|🚧\|Construction\|`E503`\|**Service Unavailable**\|Server temporarily overloaded or down for maintenance.\| \|👻\|Ghost\|`E404`\|**Not Found**\|The resource no longer exists at this endpoint.\| \|🛡️\|Shield\|`E403`\|**Forbidden**\|Access blocked by WAF, permissions, or geo-restriction.\| \|🐌\|Snail\|`E408`\|**Timeout**\|Connection established but server failed to respond in time.\| \|💣\|Bomb\|`E500`\|**Server Error**\|Internal crash on the remote server side.\| \|🛑\|Stop Sign\|`E429`\|**Rate Limited**\|Too many requests; temporary ban active.\| \|🕸️\|Spider Web\|`E000`\|**Network Error**\|DNS failure, connection reset, or no internet.\| \|🧟\|Zombie\|`PARTIAL`\|**Partial Data**\|Request succeeded but returned incomplete/malformed data.\|  ### 2\. Performance Trends \& Motion  Used alongside **Latency** `\[Lat]` or **Throughput** `\[Thru]` to indicate the velocity and direction of metrics.  \|Icon\|Meaning\|Application\| \|:-:\|-\|-\| \|📈\|**Rising Badly**\|Latency spiking significantly (>20% vs avg).\| \|📉\|**Improving**\|Latency dropping or Throughput increasing.\| \|➡️\|**Stable**\|Metric holding steady within standard deviation.\| \|🚀\|**Surge**\|Throughput unexpectedly high (positive anomaly).\| \|🐢\|**Lag**\|System slowing down due to resource constraints.\|  ### 3\. Worker \& Thread Identity  Methods to distinguish the thread/process ID `\[Wid]` to trace logs or errors to a specific worker.  * **Circled Numbers:** ① ② ③ ④ ⑤ ⑥ ⑦ ⑧ ⑨ ⑩ ⑪ ⑫    * *Usage:* Compact, distinct from stats. Good for low thread counts.  * **Faces/Avatars:** 👷(Worker), 🕵️(Spy), 🤖(Bot), 👽(Alien)    * *Usage:* Assigning a distinct "persona" to each persistent worker.  * **Dice:** 🎲    * *Usage:* Indicates a worker operating on randomized delays.  ### 4\. Compact Count Labels  Alternatives to `📊` for extremely space-constrained layouts.  \|Icon\|Represents\|Logic\| \|:-:\|-\|-\| \|✔️\|**Success Count**\|Number of 200 OK responses.\| \|✖️\|**Fail Count**\|Number of any non-200 responses.\| \|➕\|**Added**\|New items/bonuses discovered this run.\| \|➖\|**Skipped**\|Items skipped due to deduplication.\|  ### 5\. System Load Indicators  Visual shorthand for `💾` Memory and `🖥️` CPU states.  \|Icon\|Metric\|State\|Meaning\| \|:-:\|-\|-\|-\| \|🧊\|System\|**Cool**\|Low resource usage (<30%).\| \|🔥\|System\|**Hot**\|High resource usage (>80%).\| \|🧠\|Memory\|**Thinking**\|Heavy processing/parsing operation active.\| \|🧹\|Memory\|**GC**\|Garbage collection / Memory cleanup in progress.\|  ### 6\. Data Quality \& Validation  Icons representing the state of the data *after* it has been fetched.  \|Icon\|State\|Meaning\| \|:-:\|-\|-\| \|💎\|**Pristine**\|Data is complete, valid, and high-value.\| \|🏚️\|**Broken**\|HTML structure was unexpected; parser failed.\| \|🗑️\|**Junk**\|Content was fetched but contained no useful bonuses.\| \|📝\|**Schema**\|Data matched a strict schema validation check.\| \|⚖️\|**Dupe**\|Valid data, but identical to a previous record.\|  ### 7\. Proxy \& Network Types  Distinguishing the *method* of connection.  \|Icon\|Type\|Meaning\| \|:-:\|-\|-\| \|🏢\|**Datacenter**\|Fast, stable, but easily detected DC proxy.\| \|🏠\|**Residential**\|High-trust ISP/Home IP address.\| \|📱\|**Mobile**\|4G/5G connection (highest trust).\| \|🧅\|**Tor**\|Routed through the Tor network.\| \|🔄\|**Rotating**\|IP changes on every request.\| \|📌\|**Sticky**\|IP remains constant for session duration.\|  ### 8\. Timing Phases \& Precision  Granular icons for *what* is taking time.  \|Icon\|Phase\|Meaning\| \|:-:\|-\|-\| \|⏳\|**Queue**\|Request is waiting for an available worker slot.\| \|📡\|**Connect**\|DNS resolution and TCP handshake in progress.\| \|📥\|**Download**\|Receiving the response body bytes.\| \|⚙️\|**Process**\|Parsing HTML/JSON after download.\| \|💾\|**Saving**\|Writing results to the database.\|  ### 9\.

Quality \& Health Gradient (12-Step)  Used for both **Run Health** `\[RunH]` and **Proxy Health** `\[ProxyH]`. This metric uses a granular scale of shapes and colors to indicate precise quality tiers.  The logic follows a progression of **Color** (Red -> Orange -> Yellow -> Green) and **Shape** (Square -> Circle -> Heart) as quality increases.  * **For Run Health:** Based on success percentage (Higher = Better). * **For Proxy Health:** Based on inverted IP Risk Score (Lower Risk = Higher Quality = Better).  \|Range\|Symbol\|Description\|Meaning\| \|-\|:-:\|-\|-\| \|**0% - 9%**\|🟥\|Red Square\|**Critical Failure:** high risk / zero success.\| \|**10% - 19%**\|🔴\|Red Circle\|**Very Poor:** significant issues.\| \|**20% - 24%**\|❤️\|Red Heart\|**Poor:** slightly better but still critical.\| \|**25% - 34%**\|🟧\|Orange Square\|**Low:** approaching functional levels.\| \|**35% - 44%**\|🟠\|Orange Circle\|**Below Average:** frequent friction.\| \|**45% - 49%**\|🧡\|Orange Heart\|**Marginal:** nearing acceptable threshold.\| \|**50% - 59%**\|🟨\|Yellow Square\|**Fair:** functional but degraded.\| \|**60% - 69%**\|🟡\|Yellow Circle\|**Good:** standard acceptable performance.\| \|**70% - 74%**\|💛\|Yellow Heart\|**Very Good:** above average reliability.\| \|**75% - 84%**\|🟩\|Green Square\|**Excellent:** high reliability / low risk.\| \|**85% - 94%**\|🟢\|Green Circle\|**Superior:** very clean / stable.\| \|**95% - 100%**\|💚\|Green Heart\|**Perfect/Near Perfect:** optimal state.\|  ### 2\. Operational Status (✅ / ⛔)  Used for the **Status Icon** `\[StatusIcon]`. This provides a binary (Pass/Fail) visual confirmation of the specific request result.  * **✅ Check Mark:** **Success**    * *Condition:* HTTP 200 OK + Valid Data Parsed.   * *Meaning:* The specific URL was scraped, and data was extracted successfully. Corresponds to status text "DONE".  * **⛔ No Entry:** **Failure**    * *Condition:* HTTP 4xx/5xx Error, Timeout, or Ban.   * *Meaning:* The request failed. Corresponds to error codes like "E404", "E503", or "E000" (Network Error).  ### 4\. Metric Anchors (Icons)  These static icons serve as visual delimiters, allowing the user to quickly locate specific data points in the dense text grid without reading labels.  * **⏱️ (Stopwatch):** Marks the **Timing** block (Elapsed / Duration). * **💾 (Floppy Disk):** Marks the **System Memory** usage. * **🖥️ (Desktop Computer):** Marks the **CPU** usage. * **⚡ (High Voltage):** Marks the **Latency/Network Speed**. * **🚀 (Rocket):** Marks the **Throughput** (items per second). * **👷 (Construction Worker):** Marks the **Thread/Worker ID**. * **📊 (Bar Chart):** Marks the **Statistics** (Success/Fail counts). * **❌ (Cross Mark):** Marks the **Error Count** (specific error instances). * **🌐 (Globe):** Marks the **Target URL**.  ---  ## Extended \& Hypothetical Iconography (Experimental)  These symbols are used in advanced layouts to replace text labels entirely or provide secondary state information.  ### 1\. Symbolic Status Codes \& Error Mapping  Replaces the standard `E###` text codes with representative imagery for faster cognitive processing.  \|Icon\|Symbol Name\|Replaces\|Meaning\|Context/Nuance\| \|:-:\|-\|-\|-\|-\| \|🏁\|Chequered Flag\|`DONE`\|**Success**\|Request completed and data parsed perfectly.\| \|🚧\|Construction\|`E503`\|**Service Unavailable**\|Server temporarily overloaded or down for maintenance.\| \|👻\|Ghost\|`E404`\|**Not Found**\|The resource no longer exists at this endpoint.\| \|🛡️\|Shield\|`E403`\|**Forbidden**\|Access blocked by WAF, permissions, or geo-restriction.\| \|🐌\|Snail\|`E408`\|**Timeout**\|Connection established but server failed to respond in time.\| \|💣\|Bomb\|`E500`\|**Server Error**\|Internal crash on the remote server side.\| \|🛑\|Stop Sign\|`E429`\|**Rate Limited**\|Too many requests; temporary ban active.\| \|🕸️\|Spider Web\|`E000`\|**Network Error**\|DNS failure, connection reset, or no internet.\| \|🧟\|Zombie\|`PARTIAL`\|**Partial Data**\|Request succeeded but returned incomplete/malformed data.\|  ### 2\. Performance Trends \& Motion  Used alongside **Latency** `\[Lat]` or **Throughput** `\[Thru]` to indicate the velocity and direction of metrics.  \|Icon\|Meaning\|Application\| \|:-:\|-\|-\| \|📈\|**Rising Badly**\|Latency spiking significantly (>20% vs avg).\| \|📉\|**Improving**\|Latency dropping or Throughput increasing.\| \|➡️\|**Stable**\|Metric holding steady within standard deviation.\| \|🚀\|**Surge**\|Throughput unexpectedly high (positive anomaly).\| \|🐢\|**Lag**\|System slowing down due to resource constraints.\|  ### 3\. Worker \& Thread Identity  Methods to distinguish the thread/process ID `\[Wid]` to trace logs or errors to a specific worker.  * **Circled Numbers:** ① ② ③ ④ ⑤ ⑥ ⑦ ⑧ ⑨ ⑩ ⑪ ⑫    * *Usage:* Compact, distinct from stats. Good for low thread counts.  * **Faces/Avatars:** 👷(Worker), 🕵️(Spy), 🤖(Bot), 👽(Alien)    * *Usage:* Assigning a distinct "persona" to each persistent worker.  * **Dice:** 🎲    * *Usage:* Indicates a worker operating on randomized delays.  ### 4\. Compact Count Labels  Alternatives to `📊` for extremely space-constrained layouts.  \|Icon\|Represents\|Logic\| \|:-:\|-\|-\| \|✔️\|**Success Count**\|Number of 200 OK responses.\| \|✖️\|**Fail Count**\|Number of any non-200 responses.\| \|➕\|**Added**\|New items/bonuses discovered this run.\| \|➖\|**Skipped**\|Items skipped due to deduplication.\|  ### 5\. System Load Indicators  Visual shorthand for `💾` Memory and `🖥️` CPU states.  \|Icon\|Metric\|State\|Meaning\| \|:-:\|-\|-\|-\| \|🧊\|System\|**Cool**\|Low resource usage (<30%).\| \|🔥\|System\|**Hot**\|High resource usage (>80%).\| \|🧠\|Memory\|**Thinking**\|Heavy processing/parsing operation active.\| \|🧹\|Memory\|**GC**\|Garbage collection / Memory cleanup in progress.\|  ### 6\. Data Quality \& Validation  Icons representing the state of the data *after* it has been fetched.  \|Icon\|State\|Meaning\| \|:-:\|-\|-\| \|💎\|**Pristine**\|Data is complete, valid, and high-value.\| \|🏚️\|**Broken**\|HTML structure was unexpected; parser failed.\| \|🗑️\|**Junk**\|Content was fetched but contained no useful bonuses.\| \|📝\|**Schema**\|Data matched a strict schema validation check.\| \|⚖️\|**Dupe**\|Valid data, but identical to a previous record.\|  ### 7\. Proxy \& Network Types  Distinguishing the *method* of connection.  \|Icon\|Type\|Meaning\| \|:-:\|-\|-\| \|🏢\|**Datacenter**\|Fast, stable, but easily detected DC proxy.\| \|🏠\|**Residential**\|High-trust ISP/Home IP address.\| \|📱\|**Mobile**\|4G/5G connection (highest trust).\| \|🧅\|**Tor**\|Routed through the Tor network.\| \|🔄\|**Rotating**\|IP changes on every request.\| \|📌\|**Sticky**\|IP remains constant for session duration.\|  ### 8\. Timing Phases \& Precision  Granular icons for *what* is taking time.  \|Icon\|Phase\|Meaning\| \|:-:\|-\|-\| \|⏳\|**Queue**\|Request is waiting for an available worker slot.\| \|📡\|**Connect**\|DNS resolution and TCP handshake in progress.\| \|📥\|**Download**\|Receiving the response body bytes.\| \|⚙️\|**Process**\|Parsing HTML/JSON after download.\| \|💾\|**Saving**\|Writing results to the database.\|  ### 9\.

| "This script parses your bonuses.csv into a SQLite database, automatically extracting both the standard columns and the dynamic JSON fields buried in claimconfig. 1. Identified Fields Strategy Based on our analysis, the database will contain two sets of fields. A. Primary CSV Fields Direct columns from the file. I have sanitized the names (e.g., #VALUE! \rightarrow excel_error_value) for database safety.  * url, name, amount, minwithdraw, maxwithdraw, rollover, excel_error_value (originally #VALUE!), claimconfig, claimcondition, bonus, bonusrandom, reset, mintopup, maxtopup, referlink, perceived_value, is_new. B. Secondary Derived Fields (from claimconfig) These are flattened from the JSON objects. I have handled collisions (like reset appearing in both) by prefixing derived fields with conf_.  * General: conf_customBonus, conf_claimGroup, conf_mobileAppOnly, conf_displayDescriptionOnly, conf_displayAngpaoText, conf_hidewhenNA.  * Telegram/Social: conf_mustJoinTelegramChannel, conf_referlink (if any).  * Dates & Timing: conf_startDate, conf_registerDate, conf_registerBeforeDate, conf_reset (JSON override), conf_resetHour, conf_claimTime, conf_maxWithdrawTimeDeposit, conf_maxWithdrawTimeAmount.  * Limits & counts: conf_maxCount, conf_minCount, conf_max_round, conf_creditLessThan, conf_withdrawLessThan.  * Financials: conf_walletId, conf_initialFreeAmount, conf_initialFreeTurnover, conf_lastWeekTotalDepositPercent, conf_deposit_free_limit, conf_initial_free_limit, conf_ignoreTrxAmount, conf_onlyCheckIsDeposited.  * Game Constraints: conf_changeGameId, conf_fixRT, conf_offUsernames (List data stored as text). 2.

| "This script parses your bonuses.csv into a SQLite database, automatically extracting both the standard columns and the dynamic JSON fields buried in claimconfig. 1. Identified Fields Strategy Based on our analysis, the database will contain two sets of fields. A. Primary CSV Fields Direct columns from the file. I have sanitized the names (e.g., #VALUE! \rightarrow excel_error_value) for database safety.  * url, name, amount, minwithdraw, maxwithdraw, rollover, excel_error_value (originally #VALUE!), claimconfig, claimcondition, bonus, bonusrandom, reset, mintopup, maxtopup, referlink, perceived_value, is_new. B. Secondary Derived Fields (from claimconfig) These are flattened from the JSON objects. I have handled collisions (like reset appearing in both) by prefixing derived fields with conf_.  * General: conf_customBonus, conf_claimGroup, conf_mobileAppOnly, conf_displayDescriptionOnly, conf_displayAngpaoText, conf_hidewhenNA.  * Telegram/Social: conf_mustJoinTelegramChannel, conf_referlink (if any).  * Dates & Timing: conf_startDate, conf_registerDate, conf_registerBeforeDate, conf_reset (JSON override), conf_resetHour, conf_claimTime, conf_maxWithdrawTimeDeposit, conf_maxWithdrawTimeAmount.  * Limits & counts: conf_maxCount, conf_minCount, conf_max_round, conf_creditLessThan, conf_withdrawLessThan.  * Financials: conf_walletId, conf_initialFreeAmount, conf_initialFreeTurnover, conf_lastWeekTotalDepositPercent, conf_deposit_free_limit, conf_initial_free_limit, conf_ignoreTrxAmount, conf_onlyCheckIsDeposited.  * Game Constraints: conf_changeGameId, conf_fixRT, conf_offUsernames (List data stored as text). 2. Python Parsing Script This script uses only the standard library (sqlite3, csv, json) to ensure it runs immediately in your Termux or Windows environment without dependency hell. import sqlite3 import csv import json import sys from typing import Dict, Any  # --- Configuration --- INPUT_FILE = 'bonuses.csv' DB_FILE = 'bonuses.db' TABLE_NAME = 'bonus_data'  # Full list of derived keys observed in the claimconfig JSON DERIVED_KEYS = {     'startDate', 'max_round', 'claimTime', 'mobileAppOnly', 'registerBeforeDate',      'mustJoinTelegramChannel', 'maxCount', 'registerDate', 'withdrawLessThan',      'ignoreTrxAmount', 'walletId', 'reset', 'initialFreeTurnover', 'changeGameld', # Note: ld vs Id typo handled     'changeGameId', 'onlyCheckIsDeposited', 'maxWithdrawTimeDeposit', 'minCount',      'fixRT', 'showIfAmount', 'maxWithdrawTimeAmount', 'claimGroup', 'rollover',      'displayDescriptionOnly', 'customBonus', 'hidewhenNA', 'offUsernames',      'initialFreeAmount', 'initial_free_limit', 'lastWeekTotalDepositPercent',      'max_withdraw', 'creditLessThan', 'resetHour', 'displayAngpaoText',      'deposit_free_limit', 'min_withdraw' }  def clean_header(header: str) -> str:     """Sanitizes CSV headers for SQLite."""     if header == '#VALUE!':         return 'excel_error_value'     return header.lower().strip()  def parse_json_safe(json_str: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:     """Parses JSON column, returning empty dict on failure."""     if not json_str:         return {}     try:         return json.loads(json_str)     except (json.JSONDecodeError, TypeError):         return {}  def main():     print(f"[*] Processing {INPUT_FILE}...")          with open(INPUT_FILE, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace') as f:         reader = csv.DictReader(f)                  # 1.

| "you removed a bubch of stufd" | The user is stating something was removed, and the closest command relating to removing functionality is `bug`, which also encompasses hotfixes. The misspelling of "bunch of stuff" implies a bug report. It is reasonable to assume they want to report a bug where things are being removed. |
