**COMMAND:** `` `refactor_directory_structure` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Refactor directory structure with the following parameters:

- Base directories: logic, net, flow, run, base
- Rename 'dirs' to 'config'
- Rename pillar directories: 1 to 'in', 2 to 'db', 3 to 'err', 4 to 'lab'
- Use option 2 for separators
- Include original file names and descriptions of subfiles*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ad9ed547` | The request outlines a specific refactoring task involving renaming directories, changing separators, and including original file information. This doesn't directly match any existing commands, but it represents a reusable operation that can be encapsulated as a new command for directory structure manipulation. | refactoring, directory structure, rename, configuration, file management |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `process_model_response` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement a process to ingest model responses, extract thoughts and save them as raw text linked to the original responses. Handle tags, categories, review vectors, or other relevant metadata either during or after ingestion. Save the output to an MD file and append new data as it becomes available.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bd50836c` | The user is requesting a specific process: ingesting model responses, saving thoughts as raw text linked to responses, and handling tags/categories/vectors. This is a repeatable task that doesn't directly map to the existing commands but describes a distinct, higher-level behavioral command. The mention of saving to an MD file suggests a formatting or documentation component, solidifying it as a process. | model response, ingestion, text processing, markdown, data linking, logging |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `save_csv_to_db` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement a command 'save_csv_to_db' that takes a CSV file as input and saves its contents to the database.*

**Primary Definition:** *Create a command to clean up a specified directory, removing unnecessary or temporary files to maintain organization.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting a function that cleans a directory to prevent it from being cluttered. This is a task that is reusable and doesn't fit the 'TOOL_INTENT' category which is meant for building new technical tools or servers. Instead, it is a higher-level behavioral command. | directory, cleanup, files, maintenance |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `reformat_table` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Create a command to reformat a table such that a specified column (e.g., 'status') can be hidden and another specified column (e.g., 'category') can be moved to be displayed as a separate row before the other columns.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bd50836c` | The user is requesting a specific reformatting of a table. This is a reusable task that doesn't fit an existing command or a full tool implementation. It warrants its own command for manipulating tabular data presentation. | table, formatting, reformat, column, row |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `column_extension` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Create a command that adds columns for categories, tags, and other related metadata to an existing table or data structure, given two specified initial columns.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bd50836c` | The user is asking to add columns related to categories, tags etc. to existing data structures. This is a specific, potentially reusable feature request, but it doesn't directly correspond to any of the existing commands, nor does it necessitate the creation of a stand-alone technical tool or script. It suggests a command that modifies or extends a data table structure. | data manipulation, columns, categories, tags, extension |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `format_files` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Create a new command called `format_files` that formats the inventory and system roles files in a similar style to the ingestion report.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `a6712b9e` | The user wants a command to format files (inventory, system roles) in a specific way (like the ingestion report). This isn't matching any existing commands and isn't necessarily a complex 'tool' in the way 'TOOL_INTENT' is used here, but rather a new, reusable task or command. | formatting, file_management, inventory, system_roles |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `assess` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Assess the current system's efficacy and potential capabilities.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `a6712b9e` | The user wants an opinion on the current system's efficacy and potential capabilities. This is a reusable task, as someone might want an assessment of the system's performance or capabilities at various times. It doesn't fit an existing command or tool intent. | assessment, efficacy, capabilities, opinion |
| `bd50836c` | The user is requesting an opinion or assessment on the current system's effectiveness and capabilities. This is not a direct match to existing commands, nor is it a request to build a tool. It seems to be a request for an analysis or evaluation, suggesting a new command that could summarize the system's performance. | efficacy, capabilities, assessment, opinion, system |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `explain_and_execute` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Explain PEP 484 in detail, then execute actions 3, 1, and 2 in that order.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to first understand something (PEP 484) and then execute a sequence of actions (implied actions numbered 3, 1, and 2). This doesn't directly match any existing command. It's more complex than a simple 'document' command, which just expands a concept. It also suggests a new behavioral command that combines explanation and execution. The lack of context on actions 1,2,3 means we classify it as a new command rather than try and determine intent for execution. It implies the need for the agent to first provide documentation or information and then trigger separate functions or processes. The order of operations is important. | explanation, execution, sequencing, pep484 |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `chunk_and_move_report` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement a command that splits an ingestion report into 200kb chunks and moves the chunks, new commands, and system roles to a new directory.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `a6712b9e` | The user is requesting a new command that takes an ingestion report, splits it into chunks, and moves it along with other files to a new directory. This is a well-defined task that could be reused. It doesn't quite fit into any of the existing commands, nor is it simply a preference or fact. It is not a tool to be built but a command to be run. | file manipulation, chunking, directory management, ingestion report |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `generate_progress_file` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Generate a progress.md file in the ingestion_logs directory.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `a6712b9e` | The user is requesting a specific action - generating a progress file in a designated location. This is not covered by existing commands. It also implies a need to track progress and is therefore a reusable task. | file generation, progress tracking, logs, automation |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `prevent_corruption` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement a command to prevent database corruption in future instances similar to a previously encountered one, aiming to avoid the need for database wipes.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `a6712b9e` | The user is requesting a feature/tool to prevent future database corruption in similar circumstances. This doesn't directly match any existing command, but it's a potentially reusable task that warrants a new command to encapsulate the logic for preventing corruption. It is higher-level than a simple tool and implies implementing preventative measures, which is closer to a command than a tool implementation. | database, corruption, prevention, reliability |
| `bd50836c` | The user is requesting a way to prevent future database corruption in specific circumstances, implying a need for a new command that analyzes potential causes of corruption and implements preventative measures. This doesn't cleanly match any existing command, nor does it necessarily warrant a standalone tool; it's more like a feature or action the system should be able to perform. | database, corruption, prevention, reliability, maintenance |
