This appears to be a bug report related to their specific environment and CLIDE setup, rather than a request to execute any existing command in a typical way or a generalizable new command. It is not a fact, discovery, lesson, or todo. It's a one-off error report. |

While `analyze_logs` exists, it is focused on Gemini session logs. This request implies the user wants to analyze logs pertaining to the progress of a specific task, described in `progress.md`. This requires a new capability. |

This isn't covered by the existing commands, which focus on general engineering, development, bug fixing, planning, brainstorming, reviews, system instructions, context clearing, diffing, documentation, and log analysis. Creating a new command for this specific UI modification is the most appropriate approach. |

| "can you change 5 to gave Great instead of Perfect and display everything else then have the legend in a seperate modal at the very end, also can you mockup initiliazation and finalization" | The user wants to automate a repetitive task involving text manipulation and UI elements (modal). This requires software engineering to implement the logic for text replacement, data display, and UI design. The user essentially is describing a need for a small program, which falls under 'engineer'. Also requests mocking up initialization and finalization, which are software development concepts. |

This includes rearranging data fields, renaming fields, defining fixed output lines for a specific status, and cleaning up extraneous characters. The request also includes a more detailed finalization report including metrics and historical data. This goes beyond simply analyzing logs, and requires creating a new tool/command for data transformation and reporting. |

While 'dev' might be *related*, it's too broad. A specific 'checkout' command would be more appropriate and reusable. The misspelling of 'check' likely indicates a user input issue rather than a specific intent to use an existing misspelled command. |

| "Probably time to cleanup unecesarry files" | The user wants to automate a repetitive task: cleaning up unnecessary files. None of the existing commands directly address this, making it a potential candidate for a new, reusable command. The user explicitly mentions the automation aspect which goes beyond a simple one off shell command (DISCOVERY) and suggests it's something that should be tracked (TODO). The language implies a need for an automated system. |

| "Now can you isolate the the core source code, create a mermaid diagram of the modular architecture and then refactor the core for efficiency focusing on eliminating any redundancies or dead code?" | The user is requesting a series of actions: isolate source code, create a diagram, and refactor the code. This doesn't directly match any existing command. While 'engineer' might encompass some aspects, a dedicated 'refactor' command would encapsulate the specific workflow requested. It's a potentially reusable process, focusing on code improvement through restructuring and optimization. |

| "does net seem obviously illogical to save the exports in a directory code in" | The user wants to automate a repetitive task. While existing commands might contribute to automating a task, none directly address the core intent of automating a repetitive process based on potentially illogical code. The phrase 'does net seem obviously illogical to save the exports in a directory code in' suggests code that might be saving data to a wrong location. Automating the process of checking and correcting such scenarios warrants a new command. |

| "does it not seem obviously illogical to save the exports in a directory called in..?" | The user is explicitly requesting automation of a repetitive task. While 'engineer' could be a general starting point, the request focuses on a specific automation need rather than general software engineering. The sentiment expresses a clear requirement for a process to handle the repetitive task. |

While 'dev' might cover the automation, the explicit documentation request suggests a combined command would be more appropriate and reusable. There is a 'document' command, but it doesn't include the automation aspect. Combining these actions into a single command streamlines the workflow. |

| "it has 500 can you try no limit" | The user is requesting automation of a repetitive task. While the 'dev' command might encompass automation, the request implies a potentially novel automation tool specifically designed for user-defined tasks. The phrase "500 can you try no limit" suggests the user is hitting a limit on the number of iterations or similar within an existing automation process, but without one specific to user-defined tasks, a new one is needed. |

| "yee" | The user request "yee" is likely a casual or conversational utterance. It doesn't map to any existing command, nor does it suggest a new, general-purpose command. It's unlikely to represent a fact, discovery, lesson, or todo item. It is therefore best categorized as a niche or conversational input that shouldn't be processed as a command or piece of knowledge. |

| "/conductor:implement" | The user is requesting automation using a command `/conductor:implement`. This suggests a desire to execute an 'implement' action using a 'conductor' tool. Since no command explicitly matches 'conductor', this is best categorized as a request for a new command. The current commands involve various roles and protocols, but nothing that sounds like a general system conductor. We're presuming from the 'automate' request that this task is repetitive. |
