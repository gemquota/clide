**COMMAND:** `` `explain` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Create a command that generates a prompt which describes the process used to generate a specific concept file (e.g., concept.md).*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `64caaf6a` | The user is asking for a new command to generate a prompt that describes the process behind generating 'concept.md'. This is a reusable task as it provides an explanation of how a specific concept file was created, which could be helpful for understanding the context and rationale behind it. It doesn't fit into any of the existing commands, and it's not a technical tool to be built, but rather a specific action to be performed. | explanation, prompt generation, concept, documentation |

**COMMAND:** `` `security_audit` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Security Audit Process: Analyze an asset (e.g., code snippet) for security risks (dangerous shell commands, hardcoded secrets, excessive permissions). Return a JSON object with rating (SAFE, CAUTION, DANGEROUS), a list of specific risks, and suggested mitigations.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `15afe697` | This request defines a clear, reusable task: auditing an asset for security risks and returning a JSON object with the findings. It doesn't fit any of the existing commands. It's also not a TOOL_INTENT as it is an instruction to perform a task, rather than a request to *build* a tool. | security, audit, code analysis, vulnerability, risk assessment |
| `a08efcd8` | This request defines a specific and reusable task: performing a security audit on an asset and returning a JSON object with the rating, risks, and mitigation strategies.

| `290dab7b` | The user likely wants to resume a previously paused or interrupted process/workflow. This doesn't match any existing command, isn't a tool to build, and represents a higher-level behavioral command that could be implemented and reused. | workflow, resume, persistence, state management |
| `f1d518b2` | The request 'resume' does not match any existing command. It implies a desire to pick up where one left off, which would require custom logic to save and restore a previous state. This doesn't qualify as a tool creation (TOOL_INTENT) and is better suited as a new, higher-level command. | state management, workflow, persistence |
| `9a5256fc` | The request 'resume' suggests a desire to continue or restart a previously paused or interrupted process. This doesn't directly match any of the existing commands, which are focused on specific engineering tasks or workflows. It warrants a new command to handle the continuation of operations. It isn't a tool to be built, a fact, discovery, lesson, or a niche request. | workflow, state, continuation, restart |
| `efd198ba` | The request 'resume' suggests a desire to continue a paused or interrupted workflow or process. This isn't a direct match to any existing command, nor is it a request to *build* a tool (TOOL_INTENT). It implies resuming a pre-existing state, which could be a useful, reusable command in the CLIDE system. | workflow, state management, resume, persistence |
| `c09274f5` | The user likely wants to continue a previously interrupted process or workflow. This isn't covered by the existing commands and represents a new potentially reusable task. | workflow, persistence, state, interrupt |

**Primary Definition:** *Enhance CLIDE by adding more categories and implementing database saving capabilities. Review and finalize documentation after implementation.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `b56ae17c` | The user is requesting a feature enhancement to CLIDE, specifically to add more categories and save information to a database. This isn't a direct match to any existing command, nor is it a request for a standalone tool (TOOL_INTENT). It's a higher-level behavioral command to improve CLIDE's core functionality. | categorization, database, persistence, enhancement, review |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `enhance_categorization_and_db` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Enhance CLIDE to support more categories and save information to a database. Review and finalize documentation after adding these capabilities. Seek clarification if needed.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `483e30b0` | The user is requesting new capabilities for CLIDE: more categories and database saving. This isn't covered by existing commands like 'dev' or 'plan', and doesn't fit neatly into the other categories. It's a request for a new, potentially reusable, feature. | categorization, database, feature_request, data_storage |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `enhance_clide` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Request to add more categories and database saving capabilities to CLIDE, followed by documentation review.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `fe01bc93` | The user is requesting new functionality for CLIDE: more categories and database saving. This doesn't match any existing command, but is a general request to enhance the capabilities of the CLIDE tool, which could be a reusable command to initiate a workflow for implementing these features. | CLIDE, enhancement, categorization, database, feature request |
| `5c650731` | The request asks for adding new functionalities (more categories and database saving) to CLIDE. This does not match any of the existing commands directly. It is also not a simple fact or a one-off request. It is a suggestion for improvement and expansion of CLIDE's capabilities and would be a reusable feature. | CLIDE, enhancement, categorization, database |

**COMMAND:** `` `develop_feature` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Develop a new feature, including initial clarification with 2-7 questions per aspect and implementing after clarification is complete.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `881e2e6f` | The user is describing a high-level request to develop a feature, including clarifying questions and eventual implementation. While 'dev' exists, this request is more about the overall process and includes clarification steps, suggesting a distinct workflow. Also, the request involves the 'janitor' which may involve an agent or some other specific handling. It's not a one-off as it describes a reusable process. | feature development, clarification, implementation, knowledge graph, mermaid graphs |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `configure_commit_behavior` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Configuration for commit behavior:

1. **Commit Scope:**
   - If deemed pertinent, commit every commit.
   - Client should confirm whether or not that is desired when they learn the lesson.
   - Ignore transient commits.
   - Commit only complex commits.

2. **Automated Testing:** Commit only if the user can run the tests themselves.

3. **Archiving:** Use automatic archiving.

4. **Dependencies:**
   - Prefer pure Python, but accept high-quality or standard Node.js dependencies.
   - Functional dependency followed by semantic similarity when selecting dependencies.

5. **Autonomous Rollback:**
   - If the system can save a backup to roll back, it can do anything at once autonomously.

6. **Logic:** Choose whatever is most logical for the task.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `483e30b0` | The user is outlining a set of rules/preferences for how commits should be handled (what should be committed, under what conditions, what dependencies are preferred). This is a configuration task that can be encapsulated into a new command. The information contains distinct parameters and criteria that can be translated into specific execution paths for the command. | commit, version control, configuration, dependencies, testing, archiving, autonomy, rollback |
| `483e30b0` | The user is expressing several preferences and configurations related to commit behavior, dependencies, testing, backups, and autonomy. This doesn't fit neatly into the existing commands but could be encapsulated into a new command that configures the system based on these preferences. The individual points raised need to be translated into parameters and logic for such a command. | commit, backup, dependencies, testing, autonomy, configuration |

| `e2734b94` | The request describes several groups of redundant entries related to UI/UX analysis, prompt improvement, code deconstruction and documentation. It asks for these groups to be synthesized into single, comprehensive entries. This is a task-oriented request that can be codified into a reusable command responsible for consolidating redundant information into a master entry, improving knowledge base maintainability and accessibility. This is not a tool creation (TOOL_INTENT), but rather a request to organize and synthesize existing information, suggesting a `NEW_COMMAND` category best fits the request. | knowledge_management, redundancy_elimination, master_entry, synthesis, information_consolidation, UI/UX, prompt_engineering, code_documentation, code_decomposition |
| `cc058adc` | The user is requesting the creation of several new commands. The main intent revolves around synthesizing redundant entries into master entries. The provided groups include various MATCH, NEW_COMMAND, NICHE, and LESSON entries. The task is to extract and consolidate information to create these master entries while filtering out irrelevant items. The different groups represent distinct commands. Since the user specified 'Return ONLY the master entries', it confirms that this is indeed a request for new commands to be built. | command_creation, data_synthesis, redundancy_removal, knowledge_management |
| `04dce9a2` | The user is requesting the synthesis of similar instructions into comprehensive master entries. The primary intent is to create a more organized and efficient system by reducing redundancy and consolidating information. The groups consist of both MATCH and NEW_COMMAND classified entries. The synthesized entries represent new command ideas or improved versions of existing ones, rather than direct matches to the existing command list. This makes NEW_COMMAND the most appropriate classification. | synthesis, redundancy, master_entry, codebase_review, resume_workflow, bug_investigation |
| `36665dd9` | The user is requesting a function to synthesize redundant entries. This is a potentially reusable function that could benefit future data ingestion and knowledge management efforts. It does not directly map to an existing command but provides utility for data cleaning and knowledge base consolidation. | knowledge_management, data_cleaning, deduplication, synthesis, master_entry |

| `ad9ed547` | The user likely wants to resume a paused or interrupted task. This functionality doesn't exist among the current commands. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task related to combining things. This implies a new functionality that is not covered by the existing commands. The vague request for plausibility requires interpretation and decision-making, implying more than simple substitution. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking about the benefits and execution of combining source code files, ensuring they remain distinct with clear separators. This is a code organization task that isn't covered by existing commands. It could potentially be incorporated into the `engineer` or `dev` commands, but as it's a specific request for combining and maintaining separation, it warrants a new command or extension. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting functionality to save the output (tables) to a markdown file. This doesn't match any of the existing commands, but it's a useful and potentially reusable action. A new command called `export_to_md` would fulfill this requirement. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a code formatting task to avoid using slashes in a particular way. This doesn't match any existing command, but it's a potentially reusable task if generalized beyond just slashes. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants a description of each layer of something (unspecified what) and the files that comprise them. No existing command directly addresses this. This could be a reusable function for understanding system architectures or software designs. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting a refactoring operation with specific details about file/directory renaming, separators, and descriptions. This doesn't directly match any of the existing commands, but it represents a potentially reusable task. The prompt asks to rename directories, use separators and included descriptions of subfiles which is very similar to how document works, but includes the option to refactor. Engineer and Dev don't capture the specifics of renaming and separators requested. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking about code style related to exporting files. This implies a need for a tool or process to enforce or check code style related to directory structure and exporting files. This functionality does not exist in the current list of commands. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is explicitly requesting a new functionality: saving CSV exports to a database. This isn't covered by existing commands. The rejection of 'templates' suggests that 'templates' are already being handled correctly and this request is specifically about the CSV exports and their destination. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting a command that cleans up a directory, removing unnecessary files. This doesn't directly map to any existing command, but represents a potentially reusable utility. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to move files from one location to another (either 'docs' or 'lab'). No existing command directly handles file movement/organization. This is a common task and creating a new command for it would be reusable. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to create an HTML file that can navigate and display documentation (Zen) and associated diagrams. This is a specific tool that creates a documentation viewer interface. While 'document' command exists, it generates the documentation files themselves, not the interactive viewer. This is distinct functionality. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The command 'resume' is not in the existing list. It likely refers to resuming a paused or interrupted process or task, which could be a valuable and reusable functionality for CLIDE. It isn't a fact, discovery, lesson, TODO, or niche. The intent is to start or continue an existing, but paused, operation. Therefore, it is a new command. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user likely intends to resume a previously started task or session. There isn't an existing command that directly supports resuming a workflow or task. Therefore, this warrants a new command. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The command 'resume' does not exist in the current command list. It suggests a need to either pick up where the user left off in a previous workflow or to provide a summary or continuation of a past session/project. This is a reasonable and likely reusable feature. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking to automate a sequence of steps. This implies a new command or tool is needed that can take a sequence of actions as input and execute them. The request includes an educational component ('explain PEP 484'), which also supports the need for a new tool that combines information retrieval with task execution. |  |
| `7f0c4cbc` | The user is requesting a specific process for filtering and manipulating bonus data, including calculating ratios and applying filter criteria. This functionality doesn't neatly fit into any of the existing commands and represents a reusable task if implemented properly. |  |
| `7f0c4cbc` | The user wants to filter and create a new CSV file based on specific criteria applied to an existing file. This is a well-defined, reusable task that doesn't match any existing command. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting a modification to the site's display based on certain conditions (new bonus). This requires code changes and potentially backend logic to determine if a new bonus exists.  The request involves changing the color and format of specific elements on the page, implying a software engineering task. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The request describes a combined action: automating a repetitive task and pushing the result to Git. No existing command covers this specific combination. This represents a reusable and potentially valuable automation workflow. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to understand the reasoning behind a specific decision ('why did you include conductor'). This implies a need for a general-purpose explanation command that can delve into the decision-making process behind code or configurations. No existing command directly addresses this. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to automate the process of removing something from git, which is a distinct action not covered by the existing commands. There isn't a command to undo `git add` before the change is committed, which is implied from context. The task is well-defined and likely reusable. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting a new feature to add custom emoji based on error frequency. There is no existing command that addresses this. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is asking to create mockups for a redesign, which isn't covered by the existing commands. The closest might be 'plan', but that focuses on architecture and roadmap, not visual redesigns. A new command is necessary to handle this type of request. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The request describes a redesign task with the specific goal of not losing information and potentially improving upon it. This falls outside the scope of existing commands like 'bug' or 'dev'. It's a distinct action related to design improvement and data retention. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task that involves combining 'option 1' and 'option 2'. This implies a need for a new command or tool that can perform this specific type of combination, which doesn't seem to be covered by the existing commands. The user's phrasing suggests the task is frequent enough to warrant automation. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting a specific UI change involving splitting the 'status' key into two modals (health and error codes) horizontally. This is a well-defined task that could be automated and reused in similar UI contexts, and it doesn't fall under any of the existing command categories. The request suggests a new functionality that's not covered by the existing commands. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The request describes a set of data transformations (renaming columns, replacing values, and creating new hybrid data). This doesn't match any existing command. It's potentially reusable and deserves a dedicated command. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to automate the combination of modal windows. This is a specific task that isn't covered by the existing commands, but it's potentially reusable if modals are a common UI element. The request suggests a need to manipulate UI elements, which is a specific software engineering task. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting a specific modification and presentation style for data, including the creation of a modal and initial/final states. This goes beyond simply implementing a feature (dev) and warrants a dedicated command for mockup generation. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task with specific modifications (not calling it a "mission" and adding color). This suggests a new command is needed to encapsulate this functionality. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to automate a specific formatting task for telemetry reports. This includes re-arranging data, standardizing labels, and cleaning up extraneous characters. This is a clear, reusable task that doesn't fit any of the existing commands. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is asking to 'check out' a file. While there isn't a direct 'check out' command, this implies retrieval or possibly a version control operation on a file. This is a specific action but reusable as a general file checkout function. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting a specific layout and renaming of UI elements, which doesn't directly map to any existing command. It requires a new function or command to automate this repetitive task. It's also a fairly specific operation which does not immediately lend itself to a document or engineer command. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting automation for renaming elements and is expressing frustration about the current naming convention. This is a specific task that could be generalized into a reusable command. |  |
| `183bccd2` | The user wants to automate pushing code to a repository. This is a clear, reusable task. There is no existing command that performs exactly this function. While 'dev' might involve pushing, this request isolates the push operation. |  |
| `183bccd2` | The user is requesting a new capability: to provide custom emoji, presumably based on the provided codes. No existing command handles this specific request. |  |
| `183bccd2` | The user is asking to find or generate an emoji that represents the HTTP status code 301. This is a novel task that is not covered by existing commands. |  |
| `183bccd2` | The user is asking to 'pull' from a repository, which is a common git operation. None of the existing commands directly address this functionality. It's a reusable task related to version control. |  |
| `183bccd2` | The user is requesting to exit the CLIDE environment. This is a common and useful command in interactive systems but isn't currently implemented based on the existing commands provided. |  |
| `00deeabf` | The request describes a specific configuration of proxy settings and worker delay, which is a reusable task. No existing command directly handles this kind of configuration. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user is asking for a legend key to be generated based on the provided data string. This doesn't fall under any of the existing commands and represents a new functionality. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user wants to save something, presumably the current context, to a markdown file. No existing command handles this specific action of saving to a markdown format. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The request describes software engineering changes: adding leading zeros to a streak and reordering rolling moving averages. These fall under the purview of software engineering tasks. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command 'resume' isn't available, but the user likely wants to be able to pause and resume a task, which would be a useful addition. This implies the need to save and load the state of a particular process/workflow. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The request 'resume' doesn't match any of the existing commands. It suggests a desire to pick up from a previous point in a workflow or process, which is a distinct function not currently covered. It would be useful to save the current state and be able to continue from it later. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user requests a specific text formatting operation. While existing commands cover broader areas like code evolution or documentation, this is a distinct text processing task that could be reused. It doesn't fit into any of the existing command categories, but represents a potentially useful new command for formatting text strings according to specified rules. The specification "remove spaces except after timer emoji" implies an ability to understand emoji context, which goes beyond simple string replacement. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user likely wants to access and modify some configurations or parameters of the system. There is no existing command that handles settings. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The request '/rewind' does not directly match any of the existing commands. It suggests a new, potentially reusable command that could revert the system to a previous state or undo an action. The specific behavior of 'rewind' would need to be defined, making it a distinct task. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The request '/rewind' doesn't match any of the existing commands. It suggests an action to go back or undo a previous action. This is a new, potentially reusable functionality. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command '/rewind' is not in the list of existing commands, but suggests a potentially useful function: to revert the system to a previous state or step in a process. It seems general enough to be a reusable tool. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command 'rewind' is not in the list of existing commands. It implies the desire to undo the previous action or revert to a previous state. This is a potentially useful functionality and reusable. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command '/rewind' does not directly match any of the existing commands. However, it suggests a new, potentially useful command. 'Rewind' could signify a command to revert the system state to a previous point, or to undo a series of operations. It represents a clear and reusable action. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command "/rewind" doesn't match any existing command in the list. It suggests a functionality to undo or revert to a previous state, which could be useful and reusable within the CLIDE environment. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user wants to exit the CLIDE Extraction Engine. There is no existing command for this purpose. A 'quit' command would be a standard and reusable way to terminate the session. |  |
| `55a0e172` | The request implies a need to manipulate the order of elements in the console output, specifically for RMA (Return Merchandise Authorization) orders. This suggests a new tool is needed to process and reorder the output. No existing command does this. |  |
| `c09274f5` | The user wants to perform two distinct actions: push code to Git and configure the initialization dashboard. Neither of these actions maps directly to an existing command. It's a common deployment-related task that could be abstracted into a reusable command. |  |
| `c09274f5` | The user wants to improve the 'launch' behavior by making it more balanced and consistently spaced. This implies a desire for a new tool or command that adjusts or modifies an existing launch process to meet these criteria. None of the existing commands directly address this specific need. |  |
| `c09274f5` | The user is requesting a new command to update the launch sequence/process to be more balanced and consistently spaced. This is a clear and potentially reusable task related to system configuration or deployment. |  |
| `c09274f5` | The request asks to analyze a UI image and provide feedback as a UI/UX designer. There isn't a current command that fits this functionality. It's more than just a review; it's a specific kind of analysis that warrants a new command. |  |
| `c09274f5` | The user is asking for a UI/UX review of an image. None of the existing commands cover this functionality. This could be a reusable tool for analyzing UI designs. |  |
| `c09274f5` | The user is requesting to resume a previously paused or interrupted workflow. This is a reasonable and potentially reusable task, but no existing command directly fulfills this function. It would likely involve loading state from a database or log file. |  |
| `c09274f5` | The user is requesting a complete rebuild of a 'launch' (likely a user interface or application launch sequence) due to unsatisfactory changes and layout issues. This requires a more complex action than just a bug fix or simple code evolution. It necessitates a command to rebuild the launch process from scratch, incorporating existing data, expansions, and generating a report. No existing command directly supports this specific workflow. |  |
| `b0e6a5b7` | The user is describing a desired color gradient effect for a visual element based on a percentage value. This requires a new command to generate color gradients based on given parameters. |  |
| `b0e6a5b7` | The user is requesting a feature where a visual element (color) dynamically changes to represent progress (0% to 100% and beyond). This functionality doesn't directly map to any of the existing commands, which focus on code, bugs, planning, documentation, or system operations. It requires a dedicated tool to define the color gradient and apply it to a visual representation of progress. |  |
| `b0e6a5b7` | The user is requesting a specific formatting task related to 'rma columns' which implies a data manipulation operation. This is not covered by any of the existing commands, so it needs a new command to handle it. |  |
| `b0e6a5b7` | The user describes issues with the dashboard and final report, suggesting missing configuration data and desired overhaul/data sharing. This implicates a need for software engineering work to address these issues. The request to modify existing features (dashboard and report) and integrate them, requires in-depth code knowledge and problem solving that aligns with the responsibilities of the engineer agent. While 'bug' or 'dev' could be considered, the complexity and scope of changes implied leans more towards a general engineering task. |  |
| `b0e6a5b7` | The user is requesting a specific action: splitting two modals to occupy 50% width each. This is a task that could be generalized and reused, especially in UI development contexts. There is no existing command that directly addresses this functionality. |  |
| `b0e6a5b7` | This request describes a specific formatting task. It's likely something that could be generalized and reused, making it a good candidate for a new command/tool. It isn't related to the existing commands directly but requires more specific functionality. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to generate a report about specific data (initialization and finalization displays). No existing command fulfills this. Creating a `report` command seems reusable for other report generation needs. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking for a functionality to replace static values, potentially in code or data. This doesn't directly map to any existing command, but represents a reusable utility. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task, which involves generating affirmations. This is a clear and reusable task that doesn't fit into any of the existing commands.  It's not a fact, discovery, lesson, TODO, or a niche request. It's asking for new functionality to automate a specific type of content creation. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The request describes a series of actions - isolating code, creating a diagram, and refactoring - that are currently not covered by a single command. While 'engineer' is close, this request is more specific and targets core code refactoring and documentation with a focus on efficiency and redundancy removal, which is not the general scope of `engineer`. A new command would encapsulate this specific workflow. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a sequence of actions (2, 3, then 1). This isn't covered by the existing commands. It implies the creation of a new command/tool that can execute a predefined series of steps or operations, potentially involving existing commands. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | This request describes a clear, reusable task - to replace single letter variable names with more descriptive full words. This is not covered by any of the existing commands. It suggests a new functionality that operates on code to improve readability. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The request clearly indicates automating a repetitive task and updating documentation. While we have 'document' and potentially 'dev' or 'engineer', the combination of both tasks into a single, dedicated command is not covered. It's a reusable workflow. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking a question that requires exploring the project file system to identify and describe the contents of directories, beyond source code and documentation. No existing command covers this specific inspection task. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user likely wants to resume a previous workflow or task. This functionality does not exist within the provided commands. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user likely wants to resume a paused or interrupted process. This isn't covered by existing commands, and a dedicated 'resume' command would be useful to manage background processes or workflows. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task involving combining things plausibly. This isn't covered by any of the existing commands, which focus on software engineering tasks, code review, or documentation. This implies the need for a new function that can take inputs and create reasonable combinations from them. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking about combining source code files and maintaining separation. This is not covered by existing commands, but seems like a potentially reusable operation related to code organization or build processes. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking to save tabular data that is not rendering correctly in the terminal to a markdown file. This is a specific, actionable request and could be a reusable tool. It doesn't fit into any of the existing commands.  We could potentially use the 'document' command but that is intended for more comprehensive documentation, not a simple export of terminal output. Creating a new command specifically for saving terminal output to a markdown file would be more appropriate. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting a tool to automatically format something to avoid using slashes in a certain way. While the context is missing, the request is for automation, indicating a potentially reusable command. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The request asks for a description of layers (likely software architecture layers) and the files associated with them. This is not directly covered by any existing command. It represents a reusable function that could be valuable for understanding the system's structure. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is describing a complex refactoring operation involving renaming directories, using specific separators, and including original file names and descriptions. This doesn't fit any existing command. It requires a new command specifically for refactoring codebases. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking to automate a repetitive task. There is no existing command to directly achieve this general goal. This implies a need for a new automation command, possibly capable of learning and applying corrections. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking to automate a repetitive task related to saving exports in a directory, which is functionality not covered by any existing command. This sounds like a general automation task. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task, and the existing commands don't directly offer this functionality. Although 'dev' could potentially implement a solution, the request implies a higher-level, more general-purpose automation tool is desired. The exclamation about illogical saving location hints the automation should also address this inconsistency. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to save CSV exports to a database. This is a specific task that doesn't match any existing command but is potentially reusable. The user is correcting a previous request and clarifying the desired action. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to move files to a specific location. This does not match any of the existing commands. While 'document' relates to files, it expands a concept into a document structure, not simply moving existing files. This request implies a functionality to move files between directories which is a reusable task. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate the creation of an interactive HTML index file for navigating documentation and associated diagrams. This is a clearly defined, reusable task that doesn't directly correspond to any of the existing commands. It warrants a new command for creating such navigators. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The existing command list does not include a command to resume a task or workflow. 'resume' suggests a need to pick up where the user left off in a previous session or interrupted process. This would be a valuable and reusable functionality. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user likely wants the system to resume a previous task or process. This isn't covered by the existing commands. It suggests a feature to persist and reload the state of an operation. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user likely wants to resume a previous task or workflow. There is no existing command that provides this functionality. Resuming a task is a common and potentially reusable operation within a CLIDE system. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task with a specific sequence of steps. This suggests the need for a new command that can execute a series of instructions. The explanation request can be implemented using `document` command, but wrapping both requests in one command is easier for the user. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The user is asking to 'test the docs webpage'. While 'document' exists, it's about *generating* documentation. This request is for *testing* it, a distinct function.  Generating Mermaid diagrams is also a distinct task likely related to documentation, but potentially usable elsewhere. A command to perform webpage testing and a command to generate mermaid diagrams are both missing, but the request is to test documentation. Therefore a 'test' command is appropriate. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The user wants to automate displaying mermaid diagrams on a documentation website. This is a clear, reusable task that involves specific technology (Mermaid) and a specific context (documentation website). None of the existing commands address this functionality directly. It is likely to require parsing documentation, generating or embedding Mermaid diagrams, and updating the website's content. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The user is requesting a feature: the insertion of diagrams into generated documents. While 'document' exists, it doesn't explicitly handle diagram integration.  This is a distinct task that could be a new command or potentially integrated into an existing documentation command. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task and find similar tasks on other pages. This is a clear, reusable task that doesn't fit any of the existing commands. It implies the need for a command that can identify and automate repetitive actions, potentially involving analysis of multiple pages or documents. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The user wants to automate the process of finding diagrams on a website. This is a task that can be generalized into a web scraping tool. It doesn't match any existing command. |  |
| `c87317ff` | The request '/clear' likely intends to clear the terminal screen, which is a common function in command-line interfaces but not explicitly listed in the existing commands. |  |
| `c87317ff` | The command 'compress' does not match any of the existing commands. It suggests a utility for compressing files or data, which would be a useful and reusable tool. |  |
| `c87317ff` | The user is requesting a python script to extract data, which suggests a new tool or command that can handle data extraction tasks. The existing commands do not explicitly cover this specific functionality. |  |
| `c87317ff` | The user is requesting to exit the current session or process. This is a common command in command-line interfaces and should be added as a core functionality. It does not match any of the existing commands. |  |
| `a3035346` | The command "/auth" likely relates to authentication, which is not currently a supported command in the list provided. It represents a clear, reusable tool for handling authentication processes. |  |
| `ae2ef950` | The user is providing a diff output, and expressing frustration with the tool's handling of it. This strongly suggests a need for a `diff` command to analyze and apply the provided changes. The existing 'diff' command could potentially be used. |  |
| `e321d93b` | The user is requesting analysis of logs, including date ranges and completion status, along with metrics, which aligns with the function of log analysis but goes beyond simple parsing.  While `analyze_logs` exists, it is focused on Gemini session logs. This request implies the user wants to analyze logs pertaining to the progress of a specific task, described in `progress.md`. This requires a new capability. |  |
| `e321d93b` | The request clearly asks to perform a task ('merge all the high similarity pairs') that doesn't correspond to any existing command. The implicit assumption is that there is a process to identify similarity between pairs of items and this command is meant to merge these highly similar ones. |  |
| `e321d93b` | The user wants to visualize the commands within a "nodemap spa" using advanced graphing libraries. This is a new, potentially reusable task. There is no existing command for visualizing the nodemap or any command structure. |  |
| `e321d93b` | The user is likely requesting an authentication or authorization command. This is a common function in many systems, and there's no equivalent command in the existing list. |  |
| `ce75889a` | The user is requesting a new functionality to visualize the nodemap of a specific command (SPA). This doesn't correspond to any existing commands and is a clear, potentially reusable feature. While 'analyze_logs' has some overlap, this is more specific about graphing and dataviz libraries and visual output. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants a new functionality: automatically adding custom emojis for specific error types based on their frequency. This functionality doesn't match any of the existing commands. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to automate the creation of mockup redesigns, which isn't covered by existing commands. This suggests a new tool for UI/UX prototyping or visual design tasks. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task that involves combining "option 1 and 2". This implies a new tool or command that can take two options as input and produce a combined result. No existing command directly fulfills this request. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user requests automation of a specific UI change, splitting a 'status' key's information into two separate modals. This isn't covered by the existing commands, which focus on general engineering, development, bug fixing, planning, brainstorming, reviews, system instructions, context clearing, diffing, documentation, and log analysis. Creating a new command for this specific UI modification is the most appropriate approach. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting automation of a data transformation task involving changing specific values and creating a new hybrid version based on existing data. No existing command directly addresses this specific need. It's potentially reusable for similar data manipulation scenarios. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting a new, automatable task - to combine a modal with other data. While the existing commands offer various workflows, none specifically address manipulating and merging UI components/data. This requires a dedicated tool to handle such operations. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task involving text manipulation and UI elements (modal). This requires software engineering to implement the logic for text replacement, data display, and UI design. The user essentially is describing a need for a small program, which falls under 'engineer'. Also requests mocking up initialization and finalization, which are software development concepts. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user explicitly asks to automate a repetitive task. The instruction contains elements of personalization ("don't call it a mission", "add more colour"), suggesting it's a recurring task that needs automation tailored to the user's preferences. There's no existing command for general task automation with customization options. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting a specific formatting and manipulation of a telemetry report. This includes rearranging data fields, renaming fields, defining fixed output lines for a specific status, and cleaning up extraneous characters. The request also includes a more detailed finalization report including metrics and historical data. This goes beyond simply analyzing logs, and requires creating a new tool/command for data transformation and reporting. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The request 'automate this repetitive task: chevk out the newss.png file please' indicates a desire to automate the task of checking out a file (likely from version control). While 'dev' might be *related*, it's too broad. A specific 'checkout' command would be more appropriate and reusable. The misspelling of 'check' likely indicates a user input issue rather than a specific intent to use an existing misspelled command. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The request describes a specific layout and renaming task on UI elements ('live status icons'). This doesn't match any existing command but is a well-defined, reusable task that could be automated with a dedicated tool. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting a tool that automates renaming files or variables based on specific criteria (removing extra horizontal space, standardizing naming conventions). This functionality does not directly align with any of the existing commands. |  |
| `183bccd2` | The phrase 'pull from repo' clearly suggests a command to retrieve the latest version of a repository. This functionality does not appear to be covered by the existing commands. |  |
| `183bccd2` | The command '/exit' is not in the existing list, but it represents a common and reasonable request to terminate the CLIDE session. It's a potentially reusable function. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user likely wants to continue a previous task or workflow. This functionality isn't explicitly covered by existing commands like 'dev', 'bug', 'plan', etc., which initiate new workflows. A dedicated 'resume' command would provide a way to reload and continue in-progress work. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user is requesting a specific text formatting task: removing spaces except after a specific emoji. This is a well-defined task that could be reusable as a command or tool. There is no existing command that provides this functionality directly. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task. None of the existing commands address general task automation. The phrase 'you were looping' likely refers to a process that needs to be automated, indicating a need for a new command focused on automation. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task, indicating a new, reusable tool.  There's no existing command that directly handles this. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task. None of the existing commands directly address this. The 'engineer' command is closest, but is too general. A specific command to automate tasks based on patterns would be valuable. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task based on the provided example string. This implies a need for a command that can parse and process similar log entries. No existing command directly addresses this need. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command "/settings" does not match any of the existing commands. It suggests the need for a new command that likely manages the CLIDE system's configuration or preferences. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command "/rewind" does not match any of the existing commands. It suggests an action to undo or go back in the current process or history, which isn't directly covered by existing functionality. This is a useful, reusable functionality. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command '/rewind' does not directly correspond to any of the existing commands. It suggests a functionality to undo or revert to a previous state, which is a potentially reusable action. It's distinct enough to warrant its own command. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command 'rewind' does not exist in the listed commands. It suggests a functionality to undo or revert to a previous state, which could be a useful, reusable tool within the CLIDE. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user is requesting a "rewind" command, which suggests undoing the last action or reverting to a previous state. This functionality is not covered by any of the existing commands. It represents a potentially reusable tool for stepping back in the interaction history. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command 'rewind' is not in the list of existing commands. It implies a desire to revert to a previous state or step in the workflow. This could be a valuable, reusable feature. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command "/rewind" does not match any of the existing commands. It suggests a request to revert to a previous state or undo an action, which is a reusable task and could be implemented as a new command. It implies going back in the history of actions or code. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command '/quit' is not in the list of existing commands. It is a common command to exit or terminate a program, which could be a useful function to add to the CLIDE. |  |
| `c09274f5` | The request is to analyze a UI screenshot ('launch.png') and provide a UI/UX review with suggestions for improvements. This doesn't directly match any existing command like 'review', which is for knowledge review, or 'analyze_logs', which is for log analysis. It requires a specific UI/UX analysis, making it a distinct and potentially reusable command. |  |
| `c09274f5` | The request "please resume" doesn't match any existing command. It suggests a need to continue a previously interrupted task or workflow. This is a reusable function that would benefit from being a new command. |  |
| `c09274f5` | The user wants a new launch configuration built from the ground up based on existing data and expanded categories, along with a report. While 'dev' might seem related, this is more about rebuilding a specific configuration with expanded data and reporting, rather than general feature implementation. No existing command completely captures the scope of this request, suggesting a new command is required. |  |
| `b0e6a5b7` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task of splitting two modals to 50% width each. This is a clear, reusable task that can be automated, but there is no existing command to handle this. |  |
| `b0e6a5b7` | The user is requesting a specific formatting operation. This could be a reusable function or script to format a number based on a pattern. There is no existing command that seems to handle number formatting. The mention of 'before the diamond' suggests a pattern-based formatting. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task, which can be formalized into a new command. This command would execute a pre-defined set of instructions or affirmations. This doesn't fit into any of the existing commands. The provided example leans toward a daily/session initialization or 'ritual'. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking to automate a set of affirmations. This does not match any existing command, and it represents a reusable task to reinforce a particular mindset or behavior. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The request involves code isolation, architecture diagram generation, and code refactoring for efficiency and redundancy removal. While 'engineer' might be loosely related, the specific combination of actions constitutes a distinct and reusable workflow deserving its own command. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a sequence of actions, but there is no existing command that does this in a generic way. The existing commands are focused on specific workflows (engineer, dev, bug, plan, etc.) rather than arbitrary sequencing. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a specific code refactoring task (replacing single-letter variable names with full words). This is a potentially reusable task, but no existing command directly addresses it. It falls under the umbrella of code refactoring/improvement but isn't a standard 'engineer', 'dev', or 'diff' operation. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task. This is a request for a new command that would likely involve scripting or some other method of task automation. The "single words where possible please" suggests optimizing the command execution for brevity or conciseness, which reinforces the idea of creating a reusable command. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task AND update documentation. While 'document' is an existing command, the request combines automation with it, suggesting a new workflow. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking to explore the project structure and identify files other than source code and docs, and understand the contents of subdirectories. This is not covered by any of the existing commands. A new command that can provide this information would be useful. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is likely asking to resume a previous task or session. There is no existing command that explicitly handles this function. This seems like a useful, reusable function as users might want to pause and resume tasks. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The command 'resume' does not exist in the list of available commands. It suggests an action to continue a previously started or paused process, which could be a valuable and reusable feature within the CLIDE framework. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking to automate a repetitive task involving combining things in a 'plausible' way. This sounds like a useful, general tool that doesn't exist in the current command list. It's not a fact, discovery, lesson, todo or niche request. The 'plausible' aspect suggests some intelligence or reasoning might be involved, going beyond simple concatenation. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The request is for a new functionality: saving the current terminal output, specifically when tables aren't rendering correctly, to a Markdown file. This isn't covered by any existing command. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting automation of a repetitive formatting task involving avoiding certain characters (slashes). This could be generalized into a 'format' command that applies specific formatting rules. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task of generating names (likely for a specific purpose, such as naming variables, functions, or projects). The request includes specific instructions, implying it's a well-defined, reusable task.  It doesn't directly match any existing command but is sufficiently general to be a useful addition to the CLIDE toolset. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants a description of each layer of a system and the files that comprise it. This does not directly correspond to any existing command. It represents a new, potentially reusable capability to analyze system architecture and provide documentation based on its layers and file structure. The 'document' command is close, but this request has a specific focus on layers and file composition, which is a more analytical approach than simply expanding documentation. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is describing a specific file/directory refactoring process based on a set of logic. It doesn't match existing commands, but it's a reusable task. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task. This implies creating a new command or feature to handle such tasks. The user gives an example of a typo correction as the task. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user explicitly requests automation of a repetitive task. This doesn't directly match any existing command, but suggests the need for a new command that can automate specific tasks based on user-defined rules or patterns. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting automation of a repetitive task, indicating a need for engineering a solution. The comment on the illogical naming convention points to a potential refactoring or code improvement task. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting automation of CSV export saving to a database, which doesn't correspond to any existing command. This represents a novel, potentially reusable function. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task AND automatically update documentation related to it. This suggests a new command which encapsulates both automation (requiring potentially 'dev' or 'engineer' capabilities to implement automation) and documentation. While 'document' exists, it doesn't inherently tie into a preceding automation step. The request is specific enough to warrant consideration for a new command, rather than trying to shoehorn it into existing ones or classifying it as a niche request. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a task to clean up a directory by removing unwanted files. This is a reusable task and there isn't an existing command to handle directory cleanup based on specific criteria. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive file management task (moving files based on some criteria). This doesn't directly correspond to any of the existing commands, which are focused on software engineering, bug fixes, planning, reviews, documentation, or log analysis. A new command that specifically addresses file management and automation is needed. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is explicitly asking to automate a repetitive task. There is no 'automate' command currently, and the request implies a desire to create one. The statement "finally I just had to ask you like six different times" suggests this task has been repeatedly performed and is a good candidate for automation. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a task involving differentiating between two concepts. This isn't covered by any existing command and represents a potentially reusable tool for comparing and contrasting terms. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting a tool that generates an interactive HTML index to navigate and display documentation, including associated diagrams. This functionality is not directly covered by any of the existing commands. The 'document' command focuses on expanding concepts into documentation files, not on creating an interactive navigator for existing documentation. The request is clear, reusable, and addresses a practical need for documentation management. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user request "resume" doesn't match any of the existing commands. It suggests a desire to restart or continue a previous task or workflow, implying a new functionality not covered by the current command set. It's distinct from existing commands like 'engineer,' 'dev,' or 'plan,' which initiate specific processes rather than resuming them. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user likely wants to either resume a paused task or summarize a previous activity. Neither functionality is present among the given commands. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user likely wants to resume a previous task or session. There is no existing command that provides this functionality. It represents a reusable tool to continue work, making it a viable new command. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The request "whats the next phase?" implies a need to determine the subsequent step in a process or project. There isn't a command for this within the existing list. It represents a potentially reusable function. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a specific sequence of actions, which isn't covered by the existing commands.  The request includes both automation (sequence execution) and a knowledge review (PEP 484 explanation). The combined nature of the request suggests a new tool is needed. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The request describes two distinct actions: generating mermaid diagrams and testing a webpage. There isn't an existing command to handle this specific combined task. It could be broken into two distinct tasks, but as a combined request it can be considered a potentially useful combined command. The existing 'document' command handles documentation, and this is extending that into generating the diagrams and testing the webpage. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The user wants to automate displaying mermaid diagrams on the documentation website. This is a new, specific functionality not covered by existing commands.  While `document` is close, it creates the documentation structure but doesn't automate visualization of mermaid diagrams. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The request is asking for a specific type of content to be added (diagrams) to the output of other commands. There is no existing command to generate or include diagrams. Therefore, it represents a clear, reusable task or tool. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The user is requesting automation of a repetitive task and suggesting expanding it to other pages. This implies a generalized automation tool that doesn't currently exist in the command list. The command should find repetitive tasks and then suggest applying them to other pages within the current context. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The user wants to automate finding diagrams on a website. This doesn't fit any existing command. It's a reusable task that could be implemented as a new command that takes a website URL as input and returns the location of diagrams. |  |
| `c87317ff` | The command '/clear' is a common terminal command to clear the screen. While 'wipe' resets the entire system context, 'clear' would only clear the output on the user interface. This is a reusable function. |  |
| `c87317ff` | The command 'compress' does not match any existing command. Compression is a potentially useful, reusable task that could be implemented as a new command. |  |
| `c87317ff` | The user wants to extract data using a Python script, which isn't covered by existing commands. The intent is to automate data extraction, which is a reusable task. |  |
| `c87317ff` | The command '/exit' doesn't match any existing command in the provided list. It is a common command to terminate a program or shell session, indicating a clear, reusable task. |  |
| `a3035346` | The user is requesting a command '/auth' that doesn't exist in the list of existing commands. It likely refers to authentication or authorization procedures. |  |
| `ae2ef950` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task. This doesn't match any of the existing commands directly. The "wtf 100% failure rate" suggests it might involve debugging, but the primary intent is automation of a repetitive failing task. This merits a dedicated command that could possibly leverage existing ones like bug or analyze_logs. |  |
| `e321d93b` | The request asks for analysis of progress.md and Gemini logs, including date ranges and metrics.  While 'analyze_logs' exists, it focuses on Gemini logs and not general progress tracking.  A command to analyze project progress, including logs and a specific file, is new and reusable. |  |
| `e321d93b` | The user is requesting a new command to merge highly similar pairs. This functionality doesn't exist within the current command set. The prefix 'ye, but first' suggest this is a task that needs to happen before further work. |  |
| `e321d93b` | The user wants to visualize the commands in a nodemap SPA using advanced graphing libraries. This is a specific task not covered by the existing commands. It's a new, potentially reusable tool for visualizing relationships between commands or system states. |  |
| `e321d93b` | The request '/auth' does not match any of the existing commands. It likely implies a request for authentication or authorization, which is a common and reusable task that is not currently covered by the defined commands. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting the creation of redesign mockups, which doesn't fall under any of the existing command categories (engineer is too broad, dev is for implementation, etc.). This seems like a potentially reusable task for generating redesigns. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting a new command to combine 'option 1 and 2'. This doesn't match any existing commands, and suggests a reusable task. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting a specific automation task to split a status key into two separate modals (health and error codes) with a horizontal split. This doesn't directly map to any of the existing commands and seems like a reusable function. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to automate a series of data transformations. This is a clear, reusable task that doesn't directly map to any existing command. It involves find/replace operations, abbreviation, and data combination/fusion. It has potential for wider use cases beyond this specific instance. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task of combining modals. This is a clear and potentially reusable operation on UI elements, but there's no existing command that directly addresses this. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user requests to automate a task involving data transformation and UI element generation (mockup). This functionality is not covered by any of the existing commands. The request outlines a clear, repeatable task that could be implemented as a new tool. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task and customize it. This does not fit any of the existing command categories, but represents a reusable capability that can be formalized into a new command or function.  The request includes elements of automation, customization (color), and renaming (not a mission). |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting a specific type of data transformation and formatting, involving telemetry, network data, health status, and report generation. This functionality doesn't directly match any existing command but seems like a reusable tool for formatting and presenting telemetry data. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is asking to automate a file checkout. This isn't a direct match for any existing command, and the functionality of checking out a file is a clear, reusable task. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The request is to automate a specific UI resizing and renaming task. None of the existing commands directly address this kind of UI manipulation. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting an automated solution to rename files (specifically 'Health and Status') based on certain criteria (avoiding extra horizontal space, potentially adding a third sub modal). This isn't covered by any existing command and represents a reusable tool. |  |
| `183bccd2` | The user wants to exit the CLIDE environment. There is no existing command that performs this action. This is a standard and reusable function for a CLI tool. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user likely wants to resume a previously interrupted or paused task or workflow. There is no existing command that explicitly handles resuming a task. This implies a new functionality to save/load state and continue processing. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user is requesting a new text formatting functionality. No existing command directly addresses this specific text manipulation task (removing spaces with an exception). This request needs to be a tool or reusable task. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task, which isn't directly covered by existing commands.  The phrase 'you were looping' implies the task involves some kind of iterative process. A command to automate repetitive tasks based on observation of a loop pattern would be useful. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user is requesting automation of a repetitive task which involves modifying existing code (refactoring). There isn't a command that directly addresses refactoring or code modification based on a specific pattern. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task. The existing commands don't directly address automation in a generic way based on user input. This suggests the need for a new command that can take a pattern or example of a repetitive task and automate it, potentially through scripting or other means. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task based on an example. None of the existing commands directly address task automation from a given example. This likely involves pattern recognition and script generation. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The request '/settings' doesn't match any existing command. It implies a desire to modify or view the current configuration of the CLIDE environment, which would require a new command dedicated to managing settings. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command 'rewind' is not in the existing list of commands. It suggests the ability to revert to a previous state or point in the interaction history. This is a potentially reusable function. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The request '/rewind' doesn't match any of the existing commands. It implies reverting to a previous state, which is a clear, reusable task for a system that maintains history. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command "/rewind" does not match any of the existing commands. It suggests a desire to revert to a previous state or undo an action, which is a potentially useful and reusable function. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user is requesting a 'rewind' command, which implies going back to a previous state or step. This isn't an existing command, and the functionality is reasonably reusable. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command '/rewind' does not match any of the existing commands. It seems to imply reverting to a previous state or undoing recent actions, which is a reusable task in a software development context. This would be different from 'wipe' which clears all context. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command 'rewind' doesn't exist in the list of available commands. It implies going back to a previous state or step in the interaction. This functionality, allowing the user to revert to a prior state of a process or workflow, would be a useful and reusable tool. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user is requesting a command to terminate the CLIDE session. This is a clear, reusable task that doesn't currently exist among the specified commands. |  |
| `c09274f5` | The request "please resume" implies continuing a previously interrupted process. None of the existing commands directly address the concept of resuming an interrupted task. It's a general purpose action applicable to different workflows. |  |
| `c09274f5` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task. This suggests a new command that can perform automation. Although there is an 'engineer' command, it is not specific to automating a repetitive task and would require further prompting to achieve the described action. The phrase 'idk I like my current live feed' is unclear and potentially irrelevant, implying the user wants to automate a repetitive process regarding a 'live feed'. A specific 'automate' command doesn't exist and would fit this request better. |  |
| `c09274f5` | The user wants to automate the process of rebuilding a launch configuration, fixing layout issues, incorporating existing data, expanding data categories, and generating a report. This doesn't fit any existing command, especially since it involves rebuilding a launch from the ground up and modifying data categories. The closest command might be `dev`, but it doesn't encompass the full scope of data migration, expansion and report generation. The task is also repetitive. |  |
| `b0e6a5b7` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task: splitting two modals to occupy 50% width each. There's no existing command that directly addresses layout automation. This is a reusable task, applicable whenever two modals need to be side-by-side. |  |
| `b0e6a5b7` | The user is requesting an automation of a specific formatting task, which isn't covered by any of the existing commands. This is a clear, potentially reusable task that could be implemented as a new command. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task. While vague, the provided examples suggest a need for a command that repeatedly outputs user-defined affirmations. This doesn't map to any existing command but could be a useful tool for managing mindset or focus. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task: cleaning up unnecessary files. None of the existing commands directly address this, making it a potential candidate for a new, reusable command. The user explicitly mentions the automation aspect which goes beyond a simple one off shell command (DISCOVERY) and suggests it's something that should be tracked (TODO). The language implies a need for an automated system. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting a series of actions: isolate source code, create a diagram, and refactor the code. This doesn't directly match any existing command. While 'engineer' might encompass some aspects, a dedicated 'refactor' command would encapsulate the specific workflow requested. It's a potentially reusable process, focusing on code improvement through restructuring and optimization. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a specific task related to documentation quality (comprehensiveness and currency). While 'document' creates documentation, this request is about validating existing documentation, which is a distinct function. No existing command directly addresses the validation of documentation completeness and up-to-dateness. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user explicitly asks to automate a repetitive task. No existing command handles general task automation based on a user-provided description of the task (in this case 'did you do bsrch 2-4?'). While the specific task is unclear, the *intent* is to automate a repetitive action. This suggests a new command or enhancement to an existing one is needed to handle such requests. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking to automate a repetitive task and requesting ideas for ancillary documents. This doesn't directly correspond to any of the existing commands, but suggests a potential new command that could automate tasks. It would also need to handle idea generation. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a sequence of steps (2 then 3 then 1). This represents a new, reusable task that does not correspond directly to any of the existing commands. A command to execute a specific sequence of operations would be useful. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The request describes a specific code transformation task (replacing single-letter variable names with full words) that isn't covered by the existing commands.  It's a clearly defined, potentially reusable function, especially within a code refactoring or style enforcement context. The `diff` command is similar in that it operates on code, but this has a specific and different intent. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task. There is no existing command to directly automate tasks. 'engineer' comes closest but lacks specific task focus, making 'automate' a better, more general option. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task and update documentation. While 'document' exists, automating something unspecified requires a new command to handle both aspects. Neither existing 'dev', 'engineer', nor 'document' commands encompass both an automation element and documentation update without more context. Therefore, it's a novel combination. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate the process of listing project files (beyond source code and docs) and their locations. This is a common task in software development, but there isn't an existing command that directly addresses this. The user is specifically asking for a tool to enumerate project structure and content. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The command 'resume' is not in the list of existing commands. It is a reasonable request for a tool that could summarize or 'resume' work. Its a new functional request and could serve multiple contexts. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The command 'resume' does not exist in the current list of available commands. It implies a functionality to pause and restart/continue a previously initiated process or task. This is a potentially reusable task. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task involving combining things plausibly. This doesn't directly map to any existing command. It suggests a new command that can perform some kind of combination, possibly of data, text, or code, while maintaining a level of plausibility. The existing commands are focused on software engineering workflows, documentation, or system management, not general-purpose combination tasks. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking about combining source code files while keeping them separate with clear separators. This functionality does not exist in the current command list. It sounds like a request for a tool that concatenates source code files with delimiters for clarity. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user needs to save tables that are not rendering properly in the terminal to a Markdown file. This is a clear and potentially reusable task that doesn't directly correspond to any of the existing commands. It involves data extraction and formatting into a specific file type. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task related to formatting, specifically removing or avoiding slashes in a certain context. This sounds like a general formatting task that could be reusable with specific parameters. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate the process of generating names, possibly with abbreviations, and appending them to a file. This doesn't directly map to any existing command, and represents a new tool for name generation and file manipulation. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The request asks for a description of each layer in a system and the files that comprise them. This is a potentially reusable task related to understanding system architecture but doesn't directly map to any existing command. A new command that performs this function would be valuable. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting a complex refactoring task involving renaming directories and files based on a specific logic, which does not directly correspond to any existing command. This requires a new tool for automated directory refactoring. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is explicitly asking to automate a repetitive task. While there isn't a direct command for generic task automation, this request falls under the category of a new command aimed at automating specific repetitive operations, such as saving exports to a directory based on certain conditions. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user explicitly requests automation of a repetitive task. The existing commands don't have a direct 'automate' function. While 'engineer' could potentially be used, the task is specific enough to warrant a new command focusing on automating repetitive actions. The question about the illogical directory name is part of motivating the need for automation, but the core request is automation. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting a new automation task. They want to automate saving CSV exports to a database. This doesn't directly map to any of the existing commands. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The request implies two actions: automate a repetitive task and then update the documentation. While 'document' exists, there isn't a direct command for automating a repetitive task followed by documentation updates. This is a new workflow that should be considered. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a task to keep a directory clean by removing unnecessary files. This doesn't match any existing command but describes a common and reusable functionality. The user is attempting to describe a process for cleaning a directory to avoid clutter. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task of moving files based on certain conditions. This doesn't directly correspond to any of the existing commands.  It's a distinct action that could be a reusable tool. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user explicitly requests to 'automate' a 'repetitive task'. This suggests the need for a new command that can automate tasks based on user input or observation of repeated actions. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a task involving the differentiation between two concepts ('auxiliary' and 'ancillary'). This doesn't match any existing commands but represents a potentially reusable tool for comparing and contrasting concepts or terms. The user request is for automation, implying a desire for more than just a definition. This suggests the potential for a command that could, for example, provide definitions, etymologies, examples, and usage differences. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking to create a tool that automatically generates an HTML file to view and navigate documentation, including associated diagrams. This is a new, reusable task as it creates a specific type of viewer. No existing command fulfills this exact function. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The command 'resume' is not in the list of existing commands. It suggests a functionality to either continue a previously stopped task or summarize the current state of the CLIDE environment. This is a potentially reusable function, but currently non-existent. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The command 'resume' is not in the list of existing commands. It would be a useful command to resume a previously interrupted workflow or task. Given the system is SQLite-backed, it's possible to save the state of an operation and resume it later. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user likely wants to resume a previously paused or interrupted workflow or process. This isn't covered by the existing commands. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate the determination of the 'next phase' in a process. This isn't covered by any of the existing commands. It suggests a need to automate the retrieval or determination of the next step or stage in a defined workflow or project. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task. This doesn't match any of the existing commands directly, and represents a new type of functionality (automation of sequences) not currently present. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The user requests automation of a repetitive task, which isn't covered by any existing commands. The request involves generating mermaid diagrams and testing a documentation webpage, indicating a potential need for a command or script to handle these steps in an automated fashion. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The user is requesting automation of a task related to displaying mermaid diagrams on the documentation website. No existing command directly addresses this. It's a reusable task and a valuable addition, qualifying it as a new command. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The user is requesting the automation of a repetitive task, which isn't covered by any of the existing commands. The desire for diagrams suggests visualization as part of the automation, which could be a reusable feature. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The user is asking to automate a repetitive task and consider extending this automation to other pages. This indicates a desire for a new, generalized tool or command that handles automation of tasks and potentially applies them across different contexts (pages). No existing command directly addresses this broad automation goal. The prompt explicitly references the concept of automation, signaling a potential feature that could benefit from its own command. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The user wants to automate finding diagrams on a website. This isn't covered by the existing commands. It represents a reusable task that could be generalized to other websites. |  |
| `c87317ff` | There is no existing command named 'compress'. It is a generic and potentially useful command for compressing files or data, suggesting a new, reusable tool. |  |
| `c87317ff` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task that involves extracting data. This functionality doesn't directly align with any of the existing commands, which are more focused on software engineering workflows, bug fixing, planning, brainstorming, reviewing, meta-commands, diffing, documenting, or log analysis. A new command to extract data using a Python script would be a reusable tool. |  |
| `c87317ff` | The user is requesting to exit the current CLIDE session. This is a common command in interactive environments and would be useful to add as a feature for the CLIDE. |  |
| `ae2ef950` | The request implies a desire to modify the behavior of a 'numvet' command. Since no command by that name exists, it's a request for a new command or a feature addition that fundamentally acts as a new command. This command would likely involve counting new bonuses that are greater than zero. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting a new command to combine options or functionalities. None of the existing commands directly address this. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user requests automation of a repetitive UI task: splitting a status key into two modals, one for health and another for error codes, arranged horizontally. This is a novel tool that can be reused in similar contexts where UI elements need to be reorganized or refactored based on logical categories. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting a series of data transformations that are not covered by the existing commands. They involve find/replace operations, retention, and combination of data, indicating the need for a dedicated transformation tool. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to automate the combination of data from different modal states. This isn't covered by any existing command. It represents a clear, repeatable task. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is asking to automate a repetitive task involving data transformation, UI elements (modal), and code initialization/finalization. This suggests a need for a new command capable of generating mockups or prototypes based on defined rules and specifications. While 'engineer' could theoretically handle this, it's too broad, and a dedicated 'mockup' command would be more specific and reusable. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task with modifications (name and color), which doesn't directly map to any existing command. It suggests a need for a new command to handle task automation with customizable parameters. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting a specific formatting and simplification of a telemetry report, including aggregation and historical data. This goes beyond the scope of existing commands and requires a new tool for data transformation and report generation. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is requesting a command to 'chevk out' a file (likely meaning to check it out from a version control system like Git). There is no existing command for this, but it represents a potentially reusable task. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to automate a UI layout task, splitting and resizing elements and renaming the container. This doesn't fall under the existing commands but represents a clear, potentially reusable action. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is describing a repetitive task of renaming elements (likely in a user interface) and has specific preferences around the naming and layout of these elements. This suggests a new command or tool could be created to automate this process, rather than an existing command adequately addressing the concern. The request includes renaming an element and adjusting the layout for improved presentation. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user is explicitly requesting automation of a repetitive task. There is no existing command that directly addresses general task automation. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user is requesting automation of a repetitive task, which is a clear sign that a new command to handle this specific task is needed. There isn't an existing command that directly addresses this kind of text manipulation automation. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task. This doesn't fit into any of the existing commands, which focus on software development workflows, code evolution, documentation, analysis, or system management. A general "automate" command is a reusable concept. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task that involves extracting data from a string pattern. None of the existing commands directly address this specific need for data extraction and transformation. It's potentially reusable across different, similar data formats. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The request "/settings" does not match any of the existing commands. It implies a desire to access and potentially modify configuration parameters or preferences of the CLIDE environment. This is a potentially reusable task if implemented as a command. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command '/rewind' does not match any of the existing commands. It suggests an action to go back in the conversation or execution history, which is a distinct and reusable task. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user is requesting a new command, 'rewind'. This isn't currently an existing command. The intent seems to be to revert to a previous state or step in the process. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command "/rewind" does not match any of the existing commands. It seems to imply reverting to a previous state or undoing a previous action. This could be a useful, reusable tool, especially in the context of software engineering and debugging, where undoing actions is a common requirement. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command '/rewind' does not match any of the existing commands. It suggests a new, potentially reusable task that could involve reverting to a previous state or point in time, likely in the context of the CLIDE or a specific workflow. It would be useful to implement a rewind feature. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command 'rewind' does not match any of the existing commands. It suggests an action related to undoing or reverting to a previous state, which could be a useful and reusable functionality within the CLIDE environment. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command '/rewind' does not match any existing commands. It suggests a new functionality to revert to a previous state, likely within a workflow or conversation history. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user is requesting to exit the current session. There is no 'quit' command listed, so this constitutes a request for a new command to be created. |  |
| `c09274f5` | The user requests a complete rebuild of a 'launch' (likely referring to a UI or software component) with specific data requirements and a report generation. While 'dev' might seem related, the specificity of rebuilding from the ground up, addressing a UI issue (empty space), and requiring specific data handling and reporting suggest a new command is needed. The existing commands don't fully capture this functionality. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting a sequence of actions: isolate code, generate architecture diagram, and refactor. While some individual parts could be done by existing commands (e.g., engineer might help refactor; document could structure the findings), there is no single command that handles this complete workflow. Thus, this is a new, valuable, and reusable command. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is explicitly requesting automation of a repetitive task. None of the existing commands directly address generic task automation. While 'dev' might be relevant depending on the task, the request is general enough to warrant a new command. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking to automate a repetitive task and seeking ideas for ancillary documentation. There is no existing command that directly handles task automation or provides related documentation ideas. This suggests a new functionality related to automating tasks and generating related documentation, likely building upon existing knowledge or workflows. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a sequence of actions. This doesn't map to any existing command but is a potentially reusable tool for executing steps in a specified order. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting a specific refactoring task - replacing single letter variable names with full words. This doesn't directly map to any existing command, but it's a useful and potentially reusable function, especially in code analysis or refactoring scenarios. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking for a new command to automate a repetitive task. While 'engineer' could be related, the specificity of automating *a* task suggests a command focusing on scripting or process automation rather than general software engineering. The instruction to use "single words where possible" implies a preference for concise scripting and command design. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The request clearly outlines a desire to automate a repetitive task and update documentation. While 'dev' might handle the automation and 'document' handles documentation, there isn't a single command that explicitly does both in a combined workflow. This qualifies as a new, potentially reusable command. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking to automate the inspection of a project directory to identify non-standard project files and the contents of subdirectories. This is a reusable task that is not covered by any of the existing commands. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The command 'resume' doesn't exist in the current list, but it implies a clear and potentially reusable function - restarting a previously interrupted task or session. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is likely asking to resume a previously interrupted process or task. This is a common need but not currently addressed by any existing command. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task of combining something, but the specifics are missing. This suggests a new, reusable tool for combining data, potentially with various algorithms or strategies. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task: saving tables that are not rendering correctly in the terminal to a Markdown file for review. This is a specific action (saving to MD) triggered by a specific problem (tables not rendering). It could be a reusable tool for debugging and documentation. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a task that involves replacing a specific pattern (slashes) with a different pattern or no pattern at all. This suggests a general-purpose find and replace command could be useful. It's not covered by the existing commands. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate the generation of names, potentially including abbreviations, and then append them to a file. This is a specific task that doesn't directly match any of the existing commands, but is a reusable functionality. While it relates to 'brainstorm', it's about *generating names*, not exploring ideas in general. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate the description of layers (presumably in a system, software, or model) and understand the associated files. This doesn't directly match any existing command. 'document' is close, but it focuses on expanding a concept rather than describing an existing layer structure. A new command that specifically analyzes a layered system and outputs descriptions and file composition would be valuable. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user describes a repetitive task involving renaming directories and subfiles based on a specific logic (logic, net, flow, run, base to config, pillar, db, err, lab respectively), and a separator. This doesn't fit any of the existing command categories. It describes a file refactoring task that warrants a new command for automation. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task, which implies a need for a new command or a new feature within an existing command. The existing commands do not directly address this general desire for automation. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is explicitly asking to automate a repetitive task. This does not match any existing command, indicating a need for a new tool or workflow focused on task automation. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting automation of a repetitive task, which falls under the domain of software engineering. The phrase "obviously illogical" indicates a desire for code improvement or refactoring. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting automation of a specific task (CSV exports to database) which doesn't directly map to an existing command. The task is reusable and definable as a new tool. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task and then update documentation. While 'document' exists, it focuses on expanding existing specifications. This request implies a more integrated process: automate something AND update docs related to that automation. This requires a new command encompassing both actions. The existing commands do not adequately cover this combined workflow. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a task of cleaning a directory to avoid clutter. This implies removing unnecessary files, which is not covered by existing commands. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a task involving moving files based on some criteria. This isn't covered by any existing command. While 'dev' might be closest, it's more about feature implementation than a file management utility.  'document' is also not a fit, as it is about creating documentation, not moving files. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user explicitly asks to "automate" a "repetitive task", suggesting a command to handle automation is missing. The context implies frustration with needing to repeatedly ask for the same thing. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a task that involves defining or explaining concepts. None of the existing commands directly address this. A 'define' or 'explain' command would be a useful, reusable tool. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking for a specific task: creating an interactive HTML file that serves as a documentation viewer. This isn't covered by any existing command but is a potentially reusable tool. The user wants to automate the process of viewing documentation and associated diagrams within a browser, which is not currently supported. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The command 'resume' doesn't exist in the list of existing commands. It suggests the user wants to either resume a previous task/session or have CLIDE generate a professional resume for them. Both interpretations require a new command. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user likely wants to resume a previously interrupted workflow or task. There isn't an existing command that directly supports resuming a process. This represents a reusable functionality. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The existing commands don't include functionality to summarize the current state or progress. A "resume" command could be useful for quickly getting back to where the user left off, providing a summary of the ongoing task or relevant context. This is a reusable task. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking about determining the next phase of a process. This is a clear, potentially reusable task. None of the existing commands directly address this. It implies process management and forward planning. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task. This doesn't directly match any existing commands. It suggests a new command is needed to handle automation or scripting of sequences of steps. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task and specifically mentions adding relevant diagrams. This is a new automation-focused task and doesn't fall under existing commands like 'engineer', 'dev', etc. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The user is asking to automate a repetitive task and extend it to other pages. This implies a general automation functionality that isn't covered by the existing commands, which are more specific. 'automate' is also a reasonable command name. |  |
| `64e0d005` | The user wants to automate finding diagrams on a website. This implies web scraping functionality to extract information. While 'engineer' might eventually be involved, the immediate need is a tool to scrape and locate specific content on a web page. None of the existing commands directly address this. |  |
| `c87317ff` | The user is requesting automation of a data extraction task, specifically with a Python script. No existing command directly addresses this specific functionality of extracting data and potentially automating it.  The prompt implies a desire for a new, reusable tool that extracts data, potentially in response to the large token usage ('2mil tokens'). |  |
| `c87317ff` | The user is trying to exit or stop the current session or process. This is a standard command in many CLI applications, and its absence indicates a missing functionality. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user requests automation of a repetitive task involving data transformation and display. No existing command directly addresses this specific combination of functionalities (data manipulation, UI elements, and initialization/finalization). While `dev` might handle parts, it doesn't seem to cover the entire scope. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task and customize its parameters (specifically, not calling it a "mission" and adding "more colour"). This indicates a need for a new command that can handle task automation with customizable parameters. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user wants to automate a specific data formatting task. This involves re-arranging data (telemetry and network), modifying a field (Health Status to Health), creating a fixed output format (4 lines with predefined states), cleaning up data (removing [/), and generating a detailed report. This requires a specific set of instructions to be performed programmatically, which does not map directly to any existing command. It seems reusable for other telemetry data formatting tasks. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is asking to 'check out' a file, which suggests a version control operation (likely Git or similar). None of the existing commands directly handle this. It's a relatively common operation that could be automated and reused. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The request describes a specific task of modifying the layout of elements, potentially involving UI adjustments. This doesn't directly match any existing command but is a clearly defined, potentially reusable task. |  |
| `a0c9208e` | The user is describing a repetitive task involving renaming elements (likely in a UI or code) and expressing frustration with the existing naming scheme. They are requesting a way to automate this task. This suggests a new command to handle element renaming based on specified criteria. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command '/settings' does not match any of the existing commands. It suggests a desire to access and potentially modify some configuration or settings, which would be a new and reusable task. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command '/rewind' does not match any existing command.  The context implies it relates to stepping back to a previous state or point in the conversation/execution. This is a clearly reusable function for a conversational agent. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command '/rewind' does not match any of the existing commands. It suggests an action to revert or go back to a previous state, which could be useful as a standalone command. It is a clear and potentially reusable task. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command '/rewind' does not match any of the existing commands. It suggests a new functionality, likely to revert to a previous state or undo a previous action within the CLIDE environment. This could be a potentially reusable function. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The request '/rewind' does not match any existing command. It suggests a functionality to go back to a previous state or context, which is a reusable task. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user wants to revert to a previous state or point in the interaction. This is a useful and general functionality that doesn't exist yet but could be implemented, e.g., by saving and restoring the conversational context. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The command 'rewind' does not exist in the current list of commands. It implies the action of reverting to a previous state or step, which could be useful in various workflows. |  |
| `290dab7b` | The user wants to terminate the current CLIDE session. This functionality doesn't currently exist as a specific command based on the provided list. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task and is looking for ideas on how to do so. This implies a need for a new command that either automates existing workflows or suggests methods for automation. The request also asks for 'ancillary docs ideas' implying the automation might involve documentation related steps. This does not align with the functionality of existing commands. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking to automate a sequence of steps. This is a task that is potentially reusable, but there isn't a command for this. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The request describes a clear, automatable task (replacing single-letter variable names with full words) that doesn't directly correspond to any of the existing commands. While 'engineer' or 'dev' might be used to *implement* this, the request itself is for the *creation* of such a tool or script. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task. This is a general request that doesn't match any of the existing commands, but is a reasonable request for a new command that would learn and then execute a user defined sequence of actions. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task and simultaneously update documentation. While 'automate' is vague, the paired request for documentation makes it a coherent and potentially reusable action. Neither existing commands perfectly capture this combination. A new command explicitly incorporating both aspects is most appropriate. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a task that involves listing project files beyond source code and documentation, and then inspecting the contents of each subdirectory. This is not covered by the existing commands. It's a general utility for project analysis. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The existing commands do not include a command to summarize or resume progress. The user likely wants the agent to pick up where it left off, possibly after an interruption or context reset. This is a useful and potentially reusable functionality. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The request 'resume' doesn't match any existing command. It suggests a potential new command for resuming a previous session or workflow. This could be useful, but requires more definition about what to resume and how. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task of combining something plausibly. This doesn't match any existing command, but suggests a new, potentially useful command for combining various elements in a creative or logical manner. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to save terminal output to a markdown file for review. This functionality doesn't exist as a direct command but is a clear, reusable task, fitting the 'NEW_COMMAND' category. The user wants to automate a task involving terminal output and markdown conversion. The existing commands don't directly address this. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a task that involves formatting code to avoid using slashes in a specific way. This suggests a code formatting tool. No existing command covers automated code formatting with specific stylistic constraints. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a specific task involving generating a list of names, potentially abbreviating them, and appending them to a file. This is not covered by the existing commands, but could be a useful, reusable tool. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate the process of describing layers and identifying constituent files. This isn't covered by existing commands like `document`, `analyze_logs`, or `engineer`. It represents a new, potentially reusable function. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a complex file and directory renaming and configuration task. While 'engineer' or 'dev' could potentially be used, this is a specific enough task to warrant its own command. It involves logic, renaming, and configuration that is not directly covered by existing commands. It's more than just development or bug fixing; it's a refactoring task. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting an automated solution for correcting a specific typo, which implies the need for a new command or functionality to handle such corrections. The provided commands don't directly address typo correction. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task. While existing commands might contribute to automating a task, none directly address the core intent of automating a repetitive process based on potentially illogical code. The phrase 'does net seem obviously illogical to save the exports in a directory code in' suggests code that might be saving data to a wrong location. Automating the process of checking and correcting such scenarios warrants a new command. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is explicitly requesting automation of a repetitive task. While 'engineer' could be a general starting point, the request focuses on a specific automation need rather than general software engineering. The sentiment expresses a clear requirement for a process to handle the repetitive task. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting a new automation task: saving CSV exports to a database. This doesn't directly map to any of the existing commands. The request specifies the input (CSV exports) and the desired output (data in the database), making it a well-defined automation task. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is asking to automate a repetitive task and then update the documentation. While 'dev' might cover the automation, the explicit documentation request suggests a combined command would be more appropriate and reusable. There is a 'document' command, but it doesn't include the automation aspect. Combining these actions into a single command streamlines the workflow. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task of cleaning up a directory to avoid clutter. This doesn't directly map to an existing command, but it's a clear and potentially reusable task. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive file movement task, which doesn't directly match any existing command. A new command focusing on automating file management based on rules or patterns would address this need. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user explicitly requests automation of a repetitive task. The existing commands do not directly address task automation in a general sense. While 'dev' might be relevant, the user's phrase implies a more general-purpose automation tool. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate the process of defining words, differentiating them, and remembering the definitions. This is a reusable task that can be generalized into a 'define' command. It doesn't fit into any of the existing command categories. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants a tool to generate a navigable index.html for documentation and associated diagrams. This is a specific and potentially reusable functionality that is not covered by the existing commands. 'document' is close, but only creates documentation, not a navigator. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The term 'resume' in this context is ambiguous. It could mean 'resume the last task' or 'resume a specific task'. Without further clarification, it represents a novel action to resume or continue a previous operation. There isn't an existing command to handle resuming a stopped process or task. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user likely wants the system to pick up where it left off in a previous task or session. This is a common and useful feature, but it doesn't map directly to any of the existing commands. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The existing commands do not include functionality related to summarizing or continuing a paused workflow or task. A 'resume' command would imply the ability to pick up where a previous activity left off, which is not currently supported by any existing command. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate finding the next phase in a repetitive task, which suggests a need for a new command to track or predict process phases. None of the existing commands seem to cover this functionality directly. |  |
| `ad9ed547` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task consisting of a sequence of steps. The task itself (doing 3, then 1, then 2) is not inherently a software engineering activity covered by the existing commands. The user wants to automate something, implying a new command that handles task automation is needed. |  |
| `4c799efa` | The user is requesting to 'geberate a new rheorycrafting report'.  There is no existing command that directly supports 'theorycrafting'. While brainstorming might be related, theorycrafting implies a more structured and analytical approach than simply exploring ideas.  Therefore, this warrants a new command. |  |
| `1a8e683e` | The user is requesting a new command to generate a prompt for a designer, likely for UI/UX or visual aspects of the 'grab application'. No existing command handles this specifically. |  |
| `1a8e683e` | The user is requesting a specific feature to save the conversation history along with the initial prompt in a specific format. This doesn't directly align with any of the existing commands. While `document` is close, it's about expanding concepts, not recording conversations. This requires a new function to structure and save the interaction. |  |
| `2e9b61c2` | The request clearly asks to create a new, project-specific file (GEMINI.md). While 'document' exists, it aims for expanding existing concepts. This request is more about initialization and setup for a project using GEMINI.md, which is a distinct function. The specific context of 'extreme personalities' suggests a specific use case that warrants a new command. |  |
| `2e9b61c2` | The user wants to automate the process of obtaining a report on the initial setup. This is a distinct task that doesn't fit neatly into any of the existing commands. It implies generating a summary or status update, suggesting a new reporting tool is needed. |  |
| `2e9b61c2` | The user is questioning the general command-running capabilities of CLIDE. They want to understand if it can execute arbitrary shell commands or if it's limited to its pre-defined set. The request implies a need for a command to assess or expand the command handling capabilities. |  |
| `2e9b61c2` | The user wants to automate the addition of 'varieties' for everything. This suggests a new, reusable task beyond existing commands. It's not a match, fact, discovery, lesson, todo, or niche. The intent to 'automate' indicates a need for a dedicated, repeatable process. |  |
| `2e9b61c2` | The user is asking the system to consider their existing aliases. This implies a feature to read and integrate user-defined aliases into the CLIDE's command handling or context. There's no existing command to do this. |  |
| `2e9b61c2` | The request 'observe more' implies a desire for increased observation or monitoring. This doesn't directly match any existing command, but suggests a new tool for real-time monitoring of system activity, code changes, or other relevant data. It could be a command that continuously analyzes logs, code changes, or other data sources and provides updates or alerts. |  |
| `8a5718f6` | The user explicitly requests automation of a repetitive task. None of the existing commands directly address generic automation of file updates. A new 'automate' command would be useful and reusable. |  |
| `8a5718f6` | The user is requesting automation of a repetitive task. While the 'dev' command might encompass automation, the request implies a potentially novel automation tool specifically designed for user-defined tasks. The phrase "500 can you try no limit" suggests the user is hitting a limit on the number of iterations or similar within an existing automation process, but without one specific to user-defined tasks, a new one is needed. |  |
| `8a5718f6` | The user wants to analyze and combine nodes, which isn't covered by any existing commands. This suggests a new function for analyzing data structures and merging them. It could be useful for data manipulation or processing. |  |
| `8a5718f6` | The user is indicating a potential problem (duplicate nodes) that requires a solution. None of the existing commands directly address the removal or merging of duplicate or 'virtual duplicate' nodes. A new command is needed to handle this specific task. |  |
| `8a5718f6` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task that is currently timing out. This implies a need for a new command to handle automation, potentially involving error handling and retries to address the timeout issue. No existing command directly addresses generic automation of repetitive tasks. |  |
| `8a5718f6` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task. There isn't a dedicated 'automate' command, and this request seems general enough to warrant a new command designed to assist with automating repetitive tasks, potentially by generating scripts or workflows based on user input. |  |
| `8a5718f6` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task involving a "pass" with a specified count (50). This doesn't align with any existing command.  A new command 'pass' could be created to handle such iterative tasks. |  |
| `8a5718f6` | The command '/clear' is not among the existing commands. It is a common command line utility to clear the terminal screen, which would be a useful and reusable function within the CLIDE environment. Therefore, classifying it as a 'NEW_COMMAND' seems most fitting. |  |
| `8a5718f6` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task of 'running another pass'. This suggests a need for a new command that can repeat a process. The vague '50' could refer to parameters or a count. This is not covered by any of the existing commands. |  |
| `d79342be` | The user is requesting automation using a command `/conductor:implement`. This suggests a desire to execute an 'implement' action using a 'conductor' tool. Since no command explicitly matches 'conductor', this is best categorized as a request for a new command. The current commands involve various roles and protocols, but nothing that sounds like a general system conductor. We're presuming from the 'automate' request that this task is repetitive. |  |
| `d79342be` | The user likely wants to resume a previously paused or interrupted workflow or task. This isn't covered by any existing command. |  |
| `d79342be` | The user is explicitly asking to automate a repetitive task using a command that does not currently exist in the CLIDE's command list. The 'implement' subcommand suggests a specific function (code implementation) related to the 'conductor' concept. |  |
| `cfd73042` | The request describes a new, reusable task ('harden the .io system') that isn't covered by the existing commands. It involves following specific instructions and coordinating with a specific role. This is a high-level behavioral command, not a tool to be built. |  |
| `cfd73042` | The user is likely trying to access or modify the settings of the CLIDE system. This doesn't match any of the existing commands, but it represents a potentially useful and reusable feature. |  |
| `36803d8f` | The request outlines a complex and specific task involving in-depth analysis, critique, and reporting of files within a directory. While it touches upon the 'review' command, it goes far beyond a simple knowledge review. It requires a systematic and exhaustive process, suggesting improvements, and generating a meta-analysis report. This necessitates a new, specialized command to handle the entire workflow. |  |
| `36803d8f` | This request describes a complex operation: create a directory, analyze each file in another directory, save each analysis, then create a meta-analysis report. While 'review' exists, it's likely a standard review. This request requires a more in-depth and automated workflow than the existing command seems to offer. It represents a useful, reusable task. |  |
| `9caba791` | The `/exit` command is a common convention for terminating a program or session. While not explicitly listed, it's a fundamental and reusable command that should be added to the CLIDE. |  |
| `36803d8f` | The request '/skills list' implies a desire to see a list of available commands and their descriptions. This is a new, reusable feature that doesn't fit the existing command definitions. It's not a tool to be built (TOOL_INTENT) but rather a command to be executed. |  |
| `36803d8f` | The request '/code-review' doesn't directly match any existing command. While 'review' exists, it's a 'Knowledge Review', not a 'Code Review'. A 'code_review' command would represent a new, reusable, and desirable tool for reviewing code. It's distinct from a tool-building request (TOOL_INTENT). |  |
| `36803d8f` | The user is requesting a code review. While a `review` command already exists, it's specifically a 'Knowledge Review Workflow'. Code review is a distinct and common software engineering task, warranting a dedicated command. It falls under the umbrella of reusable tools that do not qualify as a tool-intent. |  |
| `36803d8f` | The user is requesting a way to exit the CLIDE environment. This is a common command-line interaction and would be a reusable function of the system. It doesn't build a new tool, but rather is a command to control the CLIDE itself. |  |
| `021e36e2` | The request describes a relatively complex task involving cleaning a directory and then recursively cataloging the remaining files. While it could potentially be accomplished with a series of shell commands, creating a dedicated command encapsulates this functionality for reuse.  It doesn't directly match any of the existing commands, nor does it seem like a simple fact or discovery. It is a general purpose action and not something too niche. Also, it is not a request to build a MCP server. The user wants to clean a directory and catalogue remaining files recursively. Since this is potentially complex logic, it is suitable for a NEW_COMMAND. |  |
| `021e36e2` | The command '/dir add' does not match any existing commands. It seems to imply a request to add a directory or some other directory related function. This is a reusable function so I classify it as a new command and assign the command name 'dir'. |  |
| `021e36e2` | The user is likely trying to create or add a directory based on the syntax '/dir add osrs'. This is not a match to any existing command, nor is it a request to build a standalone tool or MCP server. It suggests a new command that can be used within the CLIDE environment to manage directories. The request is for adding a directory specifically. |  |
| `021e36e2` | The user wants to automate a repetitive task that involves cleanup and cataloging. This is a clear, reusable task that could be defined as a new command. While 'document' comes closest, it implies hierarchical arrangement and broader expansion; this seems to be a more targeted 'cleanup and catalog' focused action. |  |
| `8eb71dfc` | The user is requesting a login functionality, which is not covered by the existing commands. This could be a useful, reusable command for accessing remote servers or systems. |  |
| `8eb71dfc` | The user is likely requesting to save the current state or a specific part of the current conversation, context, or data. This doesn't directly map to an existing command but represents a potentially reusable function to persist information. 'niw' is likely an identifier for what is being saved. |  |
| `8eb71dfc` | The user wants to 'save' the current state. This is a reasonable request for a chatbot that could represent saving the chat history, the current context, or a combination of both. It doesn't match any existing commands, and it's a general-purpose function, not a technical tool that requires building. It seems like a reusable command. |  |

**COMMAND:** `` `rename` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Rename the specified folder.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `e04a1b4e` | The request is a clear and reusable task (renaming a folder) but doesn't match any of the existing commands. It can be automated into a new command. | filesystem, rename, folder |

**COMMAND:** `` `weather` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Create a CLIDE command called 'weather' that fetches the current temperature for a given city.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `85d03404` | The user is asking to create a new command, 'weather,' which fits the definition of a reusable task/tool that is not directly a new tool (TOOL_INTENT). It's a new command to add to the CLIDE, unlike directly building a technical tool or script (TOOL_INTENT). | command, weather, API, temperature, city |

| `bd50836c` | The user is requesting a specific process: ingesting model responses, saving thoughts as raw text linked to responses, and handling tags/categories/vectors. This is a repeatable task that doesn't directly map to the existing commands but describes a distinct, higher-level behavioral command. The mention of saving to an MD file suggests a formatting or documentation component, solidifying it as a process. | model response, ingestion, text processing, markdown, data linking, logging |

**COMMAND:** `` `save_csv_to_db` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Implement a command 'save_csv_to_db' that takes a CSV file as input and saves its contents to the database.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting a new functionality: saving CSV exports to a database. This isn't covered by existing commands and seems like a potentially reusable utility. | csv, database, export, save, data persistence |

**COMMAND:** `` `clean_directory` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Create a command to clean up a specified directory, removing unnecessary or temporary files to maintain organization.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting a function that cleans a directory to prevent it from being cluttered. This is a task that is reusable and doesn't fit the 'TOOL_INTENT' category which is meant for building new technical tools or servers. Instead, it is a higher-level behavioral command. | directory, cleanup, files, maintenance |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `move_files` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Move a set of files from a source location to a destination location.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `ad9ed547` | The user is requesting to move files. This is a reusable task that doesn't fit an existing command. It could be expanded into a command that takes a source, destination, and list of files to move. | file_management, move, files, directory |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `reformat_table` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Create a command to reformat a table such that a specified column (e.g., 'status') can be hidden and another specified column (e.g., 'category') can be moved to be displayed as a separate row before the other columns.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bd50836c` | The user is requesting a specific reformatting of a table. This is a reusable task that doesn't fit an existing command or a full tool implementation. It warrants its own command for manipulating tabular data presentation. | table, formatting, reformat, column, row |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `column_extension` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Create a command that adds columns for categories, tags, and other related metadata to an existing table or data structure, given two specified initial columns.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `bd50836c` | The user is asking to add columns related to categories, tags etc. to existing data structures. This is a specific, potentially reusable feature request, but it doesn't directly correspond to any of the existing commands, nor does it necessitate the creation of a stand-alone technical tool or script. It suggests a command that modifies or extends a data table structure. | data manipulation, columns, categories, tags, extension |

---

**COMMAND:** `` `format_files` ``  
**Primary Definition:** *Create a new command called `format_files` that formats the inventory and system roles files in a similar style to the ingestion report.*  

| Session | Logic Reasoning | Tags |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `a6712b9e` | The user wants a command to format files (inventory, system roles) in a specific way (like the ingestion report). This isn't matching any existing commands and isn't necessarily a complex 'tool' in the way 'TOOL_INTENT' is used here, but rather a new, reusable task or command. | formatting, file_management, inventory, system_roles |
