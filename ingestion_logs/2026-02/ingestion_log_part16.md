| "yes" | The input 'yes' is highly ambiguous and lacks context. It doesn't map to any existing command and is too vague to suggest a new, reusable tool. It's likely a conversational response or part of a larger interaction that requires more context. |

| "yes" | The input 'yes' is too ambiguous and lacks context. It could be an affirmation of a previous question or instruction, but without the preceding context, it's impossible to determine a specific, reusable purpose or map it to an existing command. It falls into the category of a one-off conversational response. |

| "Follow the atomic tasks in upgrade_tasks.md to harden the .io system. Use the Architect role to coordinate." | The request describes a new, reusable task ('harden the .io system') that isn't covered by the existing commands. It involves following specific instructions and coordinating with a specific role. This is a high-level behavioral command, not a tool to be built. |

| "now review it (super ultra review mode)" | The user is requesting a review, which directly corresponds to the 'review' command. The addition of '(super ultra review mode)' suggests a modification of the default review behavior, but still maps to the existing review command. The engine should interpret the phrase as options/arguments for the 'review' command. |

| "i increased rhe codebase investigator mwx turns do it again" | The request is highly specific and seems to be instructing the system to repeat a previous action related to "codebase investigator mwx turns". Without further context or a clearly defined, reusable command, it falls into the category of a one-off request. |

This necessitates building a tool to organize and potentially update these files. |

| "create a review dir and systematically, exhaustively, sequentially, comprehensively analysis and critique every file in this directory and suggest improvements, save each files analysis into a seperate file in the review dir and after completing every file combine them into a report with meta analysis of all the files of significant breadth and depth" | The request outlines a complex and specific task involving in-depth analysis, critique, and reporting of files within a directory. While it touches upon the 'review' command, it goes far beyond a simple knowledge review. It requires a systematic and exhaustive process, suggesting improvements, and generating a meta-analysis report. This necessitates a new, specialized command to handle the entire workflow. |

**CATEGORY:** `NICHE`

| "proceed" | The request 'proceed' is too vague and lacks context. It's likely a conversational prompt expecting the system to continue a previous task, rather than a specific command execution. It doesn't match any existing commands, nor does it suggest a new tool or command. Therefore, it falls into the 'NICHE' category as it's highly context-dependent and not a reusable command. |

| "create a review dir and systematically, exhaustively, sequentially, comprehensively analysis and critique every file in this directory and suggest improvements, save each files analysis into a seperate file in the review dir and after completing every file combine them into a report with meta analysis of all the files of significant breadth and depth" | This request describes a complex operation: create a directory, analyze each file in another directory, save each analysis, then create a meta-analysis report. While 'review' exists, it's likely a standard review. This request requires a more in-depth and automated workflow than the existing command seems to offer. It represents a useful, reusable task. |

| "⁰/skills" | The request "⁰/skills" is not a valid command in the system and doesn't express a clear intent to build a tool, introduce a new command, or provide factual information. It is likely a malformed or incomplete request, possibly a typo or a fragment of a larger instruction. Therefore, it is best categorized as a niche, specific, and likely irrelevant request. |

A 'code_review' command would represent a new, reusable, and desirable tool for reviewing code. It's distinct from a tool-building request (TOOL_INTENT). |

Code review is a distinct and common software engineering task, warranting a dedicated command. It falls under the umbrella of reusable tools that do not qualify as a tool-intent. |

| "cleanup the dir and catalogue all remainiing files in all dirs recursively, exhaustively" | The request describes a relatively complex task involving cleaning a directory and then recursively cataloging the remaining files. While it could potentially be accomplished with a series of shell commands, creating a dedicated command encapsulates this functionality for reuse.  It doesn't directly match any of the existing commands, nor does it seem like a simple fact or discovery. It is a general purpose action and not something too niche. Also, it is not a request to build a MCP server. The user wants to clean a directory and catalogue remaining files recursively. Since this is potentially complex logic, it is suitable for a NEW_COMMAND. |

This is not a match to any existing command, nor is it a request to build a standalone tool or MCP server. It suggests a new command that can be used within the CLIDE environment to manage directories. The request is for adding a directory specifically. |

| "now do the cleanup and catalogur" | The user wants to automate a repetitive task that involves cleanup and cataloging. This is a clear, reusable task that could be defined as a new command. While 'document' comes closest, it implies hierarchical arrangement and broader expansion; this seems to be a more targeted 'cleanup and catalog' focused action. |

It doesn't match any existing commands, and it's a general-purpose function, not a technical tool that requires building. It seems like a reusable command. |
