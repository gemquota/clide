# CLIDE TODO (Synchronized)

- [ ] Create a 'commands' directory at the project root and initialize it with a 'commands_index.md' file.
- [ ] Update project version to 0.4.1 in the VERSION file and any relevant metadata to reflect recent capability enhancements.
- [ ] Bump the project version to 0.4.5 for the current set of four features/tasks and schedule a follow-up brainstorming session once they are implemented.
- [ ] Perform a comprehensive audit of all commands in .gemini/commands, synchronize them into the CLIDE database, and update swarm/commands/commands_index.md to include missing entries like 'analyze_logs'.
- [ ] Generate a 'commands' directory at the project root and a 'commands_index.md' file within it.
- [ ] Verify that all command files in `.gemini/commands` (and `swarm/commands`) are integrated into CLIDE and ensure `swarm/commands/commands_index.md` is synchronized with the actual directory contents.
- [ ] Ensure the project is maintained as a Git repository for version control and metadata tracking.
- [ ] Refine the baseline and implement 6 additional features for version 0.6.0.
