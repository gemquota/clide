# PDB: v0.6.0 Roadmap Brainstorm
**Status**: Draft | **Version Target**: 0.6.0

## 1. Primary Objectives: "The Autonomous & Secure Era"
The goal for v0.6.0 is to move from a "Passive Forge" to an "Active Orchestrator." This involves self-healing logic, security sandboxing, and deeper agentic integration.

## 2. Proposed Features

### A. Auto-Repair & Self-Healing (The "Healer" Loop)
- **Problem**: Synthesized MCP servers might have syntax errors or missing imports.
- **Solution**: CLIDE attempts a "dry run" of every generated MCP server. If it fails, CLIDE feeds the error back to Gemini to "Self-Repair" the code before final saving.

### B. Security Sandbox & Audit Phase
- **Problem**: Blindly extracting shell history into executable tools is a major security risk.
- **Solution**: Implement a mandatory "Security Auditor" prompt. Before the user is asked to save an asset, CLIDE generates a risk report (e.g., "Warning: This command uses `rm -rf` on variable paths").

### C. Dependency Management (The `uv` Integration)
- **Problem**: MCP servers might need external libraries not currently in the environment.
- **Solution**: CLIDE automatically detects required imports in synthesized code and generates a companion `requirements.txt` or a `uv` compatible header.

### D. LLM-Native Search (RAG Interface)
- **Problem**: Cosine similarity is limited for complex queries.
- **Solution**: Integrate a "Search Agent" into `./clide search`. Instead of just returning matches, it uses RAG to explain *how* a specific tool in the database can solve the user's current problem.

### E. Visual Registry (Static Site Generator)
- **Problem**: Browsing the database in the terminal can be cumbersome for large registries.
- **Solution**: A command `./clide dashboard` that generates a clean, searchable HTML/Markdown site representing the "Database: Everything."

## 4. Expansion Features (New in v0.5.0)

### F. Contextual Memory Injection (Live Context)
- **Problem**: Suggestions are currently print-only.
- **Solution**: CLIDE automatically injects a "Relevant Tools" block into the Gemini session's system context when a specific directory is entered, so the agent *already knows* which custom tools are available without being told.

### G. Multi-File "Package" Synthesis
- **Problem**: Extracted tasks often need more than one file (e.g., code + README + tests).
- **Solution**: CLIDE synthesizes a full "Asset Package" (a directory) instead of just a single file, including basic unit tests for the logic.

### H. Asset Versioning & One-Click Rollback
- **Problem**: A new synthesis or self-refactor might break a working tool.
- **Solution**: Leverage the Git backend to provide a `./clide rollback <asset_name>` command that restores the previous version of any specific tool.

### I. Interaction Provenance (The "Replay" System)
- **Problem**: After a week, you might forget *why* a tool was created.
- **Solution**: CLIDE stores the specific chat snippet or shell sequence that led to the extraction. `./clide why <asset_name>` displays the original context that birthed the tool.

### J. Autonomous Cleanup & Merging (The "Janitor")
- **Problem**: Over time, multiple similar tools might be created despite alerts.
- **Solution**: A background task that identifies overlapping tools and proposes a "Merge Plan" to combine them into a single, more robust command.

### K. Standardized Telemetry & Analytics
- **Problem**: No visibility into which extracted tools are actually effective.
- **Solution**: Track not just "usage count" but "success rate" (e.g., did the tool crash or return a valid response?). This data informs which tools are promoted or pruned.

## 5. Technical Challenges
- **Latency**: Running "dry runs," security audits, and RAG lookups adds time.
- **Dependency Isolation**: Should each MCP server have its own virtual environment?
- **Embedding Quality**: Moving to a standard 768-dim embedding model for better search accuracy.
