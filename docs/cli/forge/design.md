# FORGE DESIGN

- Creates a Markdown specification outlining functions and dependencies.
- Useful for complex tools where multi-step logic is required.
- Acts as the 'Strategic Roadmap' for subsequent build commands.
Usage: ./cli forge design <description>

TECHNICAL DEEP-DIVE:
The 'design' command is the 'Architectural Layer' of the Forge.
1. Drafting: Uses the LLM to expand a one-line prompt into a multi-page spec.
2. Structure: Includes 'Function Signatures', 'Data Flow', and 'External PyPI Requirements'.
3. Verification: Adheres to the 'agents.md' behavioral constitution.
4. Persistence: Saves the blueprint to 'conductor/tracks/' for phased implementation.
Essential for 'High-Order Engineering' tasks that exceed single-prompt synthesis.
