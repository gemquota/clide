# PHILOSOPHY // DATABASE: EVERYTHING

CLIDE is built on the premise that in an AI-driven development environment, **context is the most valuable asset**. Standard development creates an "Ephemeral Intent Gap"—a disconnect between the high-level intent discussed with an AI and the low-level code that results. CLIDE closes this gap by transforming every interaction into structured, permanent knowledge.

### The Ephemeral Intent Gap
When you collaborate with an LLM, valuable insights, design decisions, and project lessons are often lost in transient chat logs. CLIDE captures the "Neural Stream" (your interactions) and the "Operational Stream" (your shell activity), formalizing them into a retrieval-augmented registry.

### Core Principles

<card>
title: THE FOUR PILLARS
Passive Observation: Ingest data without changing user workflow.
Semantic Permanence: Every insight is embedded and indexed for future RAG.
Agentic Synergy: Synthesize tools that are context-aware of recent facts.
Entropy Reduction: Proactively prune noise and categorize chaos.

#### 1. Passive Observation
The system operates primarily in the background. By monitoring filesystem events and shell history, CLIDE learns from what you *do*, not just what you *tell* it to document.

#### 2. Semantic Permanence
We treat every piece of project knowledge as a vector in 768D semantic space. This allows the system to recall relevant lessons or facts exactly when they are needed by future agents, eliminating the need for manual context-setting.

#### 3. Agentic Synergy
Tools forged by CLIDE are not generic. They are "Project-Aware," meaning they automatically inherit the latest project context, coding styles, and architectural decisions stored in the database.

#### 4. Entropy Reduction
Raw data is chaotic. CLIDE utilizes automated cleanup cycles (`maintain`) and strategic prioritization (`run`) to ensure the knowledge base remains high-fidelity. We prefer a small, accurate brain over a massive, contradictory one.

### The Mission
To transform a static project directory into a **Living Knowledge Operating System** where the gap between intent and implementation is zero.
