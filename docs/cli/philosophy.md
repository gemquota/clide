# PHILOSOPHY // DATABASE: EVERYTHING

## Tier: Basic
THE EPHEMERAL INTENT GAP:
Standard development creates a gap between 'what you said to the AI' and 'what ended up in the code'.
CLIDE closes this by capturing the 'Neural Stream' (logs) and 'Operational Stream' (shell).

PURPOSE:
- Eliminate manual documentation debt.
- Provide RAG context for future agents.
- Automate tool creation based on repeating patterns.

THE EPHEMERAL INTENT GAP:
Standard development creates a gap between 'what you said to the AI' and 'what ended up in the code'.

PURPOSE:
- Eliminate manual documentation debt.
- Provide RAG context for future agents.
- Automate tool creation based on repeating patterns.

[CORE PRINCIPLES]
1. PASSIVE OBSERVATION: Never require the user to change their workflow.
2. SEMANTIC PERMANENCE: Every message is embedded (768D) and indexed.
3. AGENTIC SYNERGY: Forge tools that are context-aware of recent facts.
4. ENTROPY REDUCTION: Use 'auto' and 'manual' domains to prune the noise.

Logic: raw_interaction -> intelligence_analysis -> structured_persistence.
This transforms a directory into a living Knowledge Operating System.
