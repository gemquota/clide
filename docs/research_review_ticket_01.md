# Research Review: Map Input Vectors

**Status**: ✅ APPROVED
**Reviewed**: 2026-02-17

## 1. Objectivity Check
- [x] **No Solutioning**: Pure documentation of `sys.argv` and `argparse` structures.
- [x] **Unbiased Tone**: Technical and precise.
- [x] **Strict Documentation**: Maps existing flows without critique.

*Reviewer Comments*: Excellent separation of concerns. The document clearly identifies the "what" without polluting it with "how to fix".

## 2. Evidence & Depth
- [x] **Code References**: Citations of `clide/serve/portal.py` and `clide/serve/guide.py` are accurate.
- [x] **Specificity**: Commands and arguments are exhaustively listed.

*Reviewer Comments*: Function names (`cmd_watch`, `intercept_info_requests`) serve as sufficient locators. Line numbers are implied by the function definitions.

## 3. Missing Information / Gaps
- None. The scope was to map input vectors, and the document covers CLI args and file/network inputs triggered by those args.

## 4. Actionable Feedback
- Proceed to Planning Phase.
