# PDB: Prototype Developer Brainstorming

## Definition
**PDB (Prototype Developer Brainstorming)** is a structured methodology within the CLIDE ecosystem. It represents the "Creation Phase" where raw ideas, extracted commands, and prototype logic are captured, debated, and refined before being compiled into production-ready "High Detail Commands."

PDB artifacts are transient but critical—they are the blueprints of the "Database: Everything."

## Index of Artifacts
