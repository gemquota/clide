# ATLAS SPA/CLI IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS

**Date:** 2026-02-18
**Status:** PHASE 5 - FINAL REPORT

## 1. Documentation SPA (Web Interface)
To fully leverage the new "Atlas Command Registry" architecture, the Web SPA should be updated with the following features:

### A. Dynamic Tier Rendering
*   **Feature:** Implement a toggle switch (Basic / Technical / Kernel) on the documentation page.
*   **Implementation:** Parse the `## Tier: X` headers from the `.md` files and render only the selected tier's content.
*   **Benefit:** Reduces cognitive load for new users while preserving depth for architects.

### B. Live Neural Topology
*   **Feature:** Embed the `map --graph` visualization using `React Flow` or `D3.js`.
*   **Implementation:** Create an API endpoint (`/api/atlas/graph`) that returns the JSON structure generated by `atlas.py`.
*   **Benefit:** Provides a real-time, interactive map of the system's knowledge base.

### C. Provenance Explorer
*   **Feature:** A dedicated "Lineage" view for any knowledge node.
*   **Implementation:** specific page `/atlas/trace/:id` that renders the `render_trace_tree` data visually.
*   **Benefit:** Enhances trust and auditability of the AI's memory.

## 2. CLI Help Interface (TUI)
The `guide.py` overhaul is significant, but further improvements can be made:

### A. Interactive Mode
*   **Feature:** A navigable TUI for help docs (like `man` pages but with hyperlinks).
*   **Implementation:** Use `rich.layout` and `read_char()` to allow traversing links between documentation pages (e.g., clicking a command name jumps to its help page).

### B. Context-Aware Suggestions
*   **Feature:** If a command fails or is mistyped, the CLI should suggest the nearest valid command from the Atlas Registry.
*   **Implementation:** Fuzzy matching against the keys in `portal.py`'s command map.

### C. Syntax Highlighting for Examples
*   **Feature:** Auto-detect code blocks in `Usage Examples` and apply syntax highlighting.
*   **Implementation:** Already partially supported by `rich.markdown`, but can be enhanced with custom lexers for CLI args.

## 3. Automation & Hygiene
*   **Pre-Commit Hook:** Create a git hook that runs `./cli run sync` and `./cli maintain audit` before every commit to ensure `tasks.md` and `memory.db` are aligned.
*   **Drift Detection:** A nightly job to compare `discovered_commands.md` against `docs/cli/` to warn about undocumented features.
