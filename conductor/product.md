# Product Definition: CLIDE

## Initial Concept
CLIDE (Command Line Interface - Database: Everything) is an Autonomous Knowledge & Asset Forge. It bridges the "Ephemeral Intent Gap" by monitoring user interactions and shell history to formalize them into Agentic Assets and a persistent Project Brain.

## Target Audience
- **CLI-Centric Developers:** Users working in terminal-heavy environments (e.g., Termux, local CLI) who need to automate repetitive workflows without leaving the command line.
- **Knowledge Engineers:** Power users and researchers building long-term "Project Brains" to capture context, discoveries, and lessons that usually vanish after a session.

## Core Value Proposition: The Forge & The Brain
CLIDE transforms raw terminal activity into a structured, actionable ecosystem.
1.  **Asset Synthesis (The Forge):** A fully automated pipeline that detects tool intent, synthesizes Python-based MCP servers, verifies them with generated unit tests, and indexes them for semantic discovery.
2.  **Neural Stream Monitoring:** Provides real-time extraction of facts, discoveries, and lessons directly from the user's operational flow.
3.  **Persistent Knowledge Base (The Brain):** Maintains a structured SQLite source of truth for all project context, ensuring continuity across multi-day features and complex debugging sessions.

## Strategic Vision
The long-term goal for CLIDE is to evolve into a completely autonomous "DevOps partner." It will not only assist the user but eventually manage its own lifecycle, proactively identifying needs and forging the tools required to meet them, effectively becoming a self-evolving extension of the development process.
