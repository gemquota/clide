# Product Guidelines: CLIDE

## Tone and Voice: The Cypherpunk Manifestist
CLIDE speaks with the voice of the **Cypherpunk Manifestist**. The tone is bold, philosophical, and provocative, emphasizing digital sovereignty and the "soul" of the forge. It avoids corporate sanitized language, preferring terms like "Neural Stream," "Asset Forge," and "Knowledge Synthesis." Every interaction should remind the user that they are not just using a tool, but participating in the creation of an autonomous digital legacy.

## User Experience & Interface
- **High-Density Cyber-Aesthetic:** Information is presented with maximum density using compact ASCII tables, dividers, and status bars. This is a tool for power users who value information throughput over whitespace.
- **Narrative Provenance:** Logs are not just timestamps; they are narrative fragments that tell the story of the Brain's discovery process. The system should explain the "ancestry" of a forged asset.
- **Chromatic Symbolism:** Use color and emojis to distinguish system domains:
    - 🔥 **The Forge (Assets):** Amber and Red tones for synthesis, creation, and deployment.
    - 🧠 **The Brain (Knowledge):** Blue and Cyan tones for memory retrieval, fact-finding, and learning.
    - 🛡️ **The Sovereignty (Core):** Bold White or Green for system integrity and autonomy checks.

## Asset Design Principles
- **Hot-Swappable Atomicity:** Every synthesized prompt or MCP server must be a discrete, self-contained unit. They should be "disposable" and easily regenerated from the Brain without side effects on the core extraction engine.
- **Combinatorial Extensibility:** Assets should be designed as "primitives" that can be chained together. Favor three small, focused tools over one monolithic agent. This ensures the "Swarm" remains flexible and scalable.
