# CLIDE: Command Line Interface - Database: Everything
## The Agentic Asset Forge

### 1. Vision Statement
CLIDE is a self-evolving infrastructure layer designed to capture, formalize, and deploy **Agentic Enhancements** in real-time. It transforms the ephemeral "stream of intent" from chat logs and shell history into a permanent, structured **Database of Everything**—a registry of prompts, tools, and MCP-compliant assets that expand the capabilities of Large Language Models.

### 2. Core Pillars

#### A. Real-Time Extraction & Synthesis
CLIDE monitors two primary data streams:
- **Neural Stream**: Interaction logs between the User and the LLM.
- **Operational Stream**: The user's terminal/shell history.
Using these, CLIDE identifies repeatable patterns and synthesizes them into high-detail command personas or executable tools.

#### B. The "Database: Everything"
This is the central repository for all agentic assets.
- **Storage**: Initially implemented via structured TOML and JSON.
- **Evolution**: Designed to transition into a Vector-embedded registry for semantic search and context injection.
- **Assets**: Includes system prompts, tool definitions, MCP server configurations, and task-specific personas.

#### C. Self-Evolutionary Architecture
CLIDE is capable of recursive improvement. It can analyze its own core logic (e.g., `extractor.py`, `intent_classifier.py`) and propose source code updates to itself. All self-modifications are gated by user confirmation to ensure alignment and safety.

#### D. Immediate Injection (Hot-Swapping)
CLIDE aims for zero-latency capability expansion. When a new tool or command is extracted and approved, the system facilitates immediate injection into the active agent session, allowing the LLM to utilize the new capability without a restart.

### 3. Methodology

- **Standardization**: Heavy emphasis on **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** to ensure tools generated by CLIDE are interoperable with diverse agentic frameworks.
- **PDB (Prototype Developer Brainstorming)**: A dedicated internal workspace for the iterative development of CLIDE itself, acting as the "Drafting Table" for the system's core evolution.
- **User-in-the-Loop**: All high-impact actions—saving new commands, generating complex templates, or self-modifying code—require interactive confirmation.

### 4. Technical Roadmap
1. **v1.0 (Current)**: Log monitoring, LLM-based intent classification, and TOML command saving.
2. **v1.1**: Shell history ingestion and MCP tool template generation.
3. **v2.0**: Vector database integration and autonomous "Hot-Swap" capability injection.
4. **v3.0**: Full self-orchestrated evolution and multi-agent asset sharing.
